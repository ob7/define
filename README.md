You can either change into the 1828-dictionary folder and cat the word you want to define.
Or us my retarded attempt at making this thing have bash completion, but adding the def-completion line to your bashrc.  Its a huge completion -W list, with over 60,000 words in the list, thats slow.
If someone has a suggestion on how to make the tab completion work better, please let me know.

It works like this.
Type def, followed by the word you want to look up in the 1828 Dictionrary.

   FER'RY, v.t. [L. fero; allied to bear.]

   To carry or transport over a river, strait or other water, in a boat.
   We ferry men, horses, carriages, over rivers, for a moderate fee or
   price called fare or ferriage.

                 FER'RY, v.i. To pass over water in a boat.

                                 FER'RY, n.

   1. A boat or small vessel in which passengers and goods are conveyed
   over rivers or other narrow waters; sometimes called a wherry. This
   application of the word is, I believe, entirely obsolete, at least in
   America.

   2. The place or passage where boats pass over water to convey
   passengers.

   3. The right of transporting passengers over a lake or stream. A.B.
   owns the ferry at Windsor. [In New England, this word is used in the
   two latter senses.]

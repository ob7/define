   COMPLETE, a.

   1. Having no deficiency; perfect.

   And ye are complete in him who is the head of all principality and
   power. Col. 2.

   2. Finished; ended; concluded; as, the edifice is complete.

   This course of vanity almost complete.

   In strict propriety, this word admits of no comparison; for that which
   is complete, cannot be more or less so. But as the word, like many
   others, is used with some indefiniteness of signification, it is
   customary to qualify it with more, most, less and least. More complete,
   most complete, less complete, are common expressions.

   3. In botany, a complete flower is one furnished with a calyx and
   corolla. Vaillant. Or having all the parts of a flower.

                               COMPLETE, v.t.

   edifice; to complete an education.

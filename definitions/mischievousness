[1]mischievousness

   MIS'CHIEVOUSNESS, n. Hurtfulness; noxiousness.

   1. Disposition to do harm, or to vex or annoy; as the mischievousness
   of youth.

   Mischief denotes injury, harm or damage of less malignity and magnitude
   than what are usually called crimes. We never give the name of mischief
    to theft, robbery or murder. And it so commonly implies intention in
    committing petty offenses, that it shocks us to hear the word applied
    to the calamities inflicted by Providence. We say, a tempest has done
        great damage,but not mischief. In like manner, the adjective
   mischievous is not applied to thieves, pirates and other felons,but to
              persons committing petty trespasses and offenses.

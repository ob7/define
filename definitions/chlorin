[1]chlorin

   CHLORIN, n. Chloric gas; a new name given to what has been called
   oxymuriatic gas. This substance has hitherto resisted all efforts to
   decompose it, and as it is not known to contain oxygen, and is
   apparently a simple substance, it has been denominated from its color,
   chlorine, or chloric gas.

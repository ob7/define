[1]magistrate

   MAG'ISTRATE, n. [L. magistratus, from magister, master; magis, major,
   and ster, Teutonic steora, a director; steoran, to steer; the principal
   director.] A public civil officer, invested with the executive
   government of some branch of it. In this sense, a king is the highest
   or first magistrate, as is the President of the United States. But the
   word is more particularly applied to subordinate officers, as
   governors, intendants, prefects, mayors, justices of the peace, and the
   like.

   The magistrate must have his reverence; the laws their authority.

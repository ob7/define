[1]turf

   TURF, n.

   1. That upper stratum of earth and vegetable mold, which is filled with
   the roots of grass and other small plants, so as to adhere and form a
   kind of mat. This is otherwise called sward and sod.

   2. Peat; a peculiar kind of blackish, fibrous, vegetable, earthy
   substance, used as fuel. [Dryden and Addison wrote turfs, in the
   plural. But when turf or peat is cut into small pieces, the practice
   now is to call them turves.]

   3. Race-ground; or horse-racing.

   The honors of the turf are all our own.

   TURF, v.t. To cover with turf or sod; as, to turf a bank or the border
                                of a terrace.

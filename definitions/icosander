[1]icosander

   ICOSAN'DER, n. [Gr. twenty, and a male.] In botany, a plant having
   twenty or more stamens inserted in the calyx.

   Note - A writer on botany has suggested that as the proper character of
   plants of this class is the insertion of the stamens in the calyx, it
   might be expedient to denominate the class, Calycandria.

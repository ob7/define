[1]fin

   FIN, n. [L. pinna or penna. The sense is probably a shoot, or it is
   from diminishing. See Fine.]

   The fin of a fish consists of a membrane supported by rays, or little
   bony or cartilaginous ossicles. The fins of fish serve to keep their
   bodies upright, and to prevent wavering or vacillation. The fins,
   except the caudal, do not assist in progressive motion; the tail being
   the instrument of swimming.

                    FIN, v.t. To carve or cut up a chub.

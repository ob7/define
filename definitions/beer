   BEER, n.

   1. A spirituous liquor made from any farinaceous grain; but generally
   from barley, which is first malted and ground, and its fermentable
   substance extracted by hot water. This extract or infusion is
   evaporated by boiling in caldrons, and hops or some other plant of an
   agreeable bitterness added. The liquor is then suffered to ferment in
   vats. Beer is of different degrees of strength, and is denominated
   small beer, ale, porter, brown stout, &c.,according to its strength, or
   other peculiar qualities.

   2. Beer is a name given in America to fermenting liquors made of
   various other materials; and when a decoction of the roots of plants
   forms a part of the composition, it is called spring-beer, from the
   season in which it is made.

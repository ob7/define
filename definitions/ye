[1]ye

   YE, pron. The nominative plural of the second person, of which thou is
   the singular. But the two words have no radical connection. Ye is now
   used only in the sacred and solemn style. In common discourse and
   writing, you is exclusively used.

   But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified. 1 Corinthians 6.

[1]behave

   BEHA'VE, v.t.

   1. To restrain; to govern; to subdue.

   He did behave his anger e'er 'twas spent.

   This sense is obsolete. Yet it often seems to be implied; for to behave
      one's self, is really, to govern one's self; to have in command.

   2. To carry; to conduct; used with the reciprocal pronoun; as, he
   behaves himself manfully. But the tendency of modern usage is to omit
   the pronoun; as, he behaves well.

    BEHA'VE, v.i. To act; to conduct; generally applied to manners, or to
     conduct in any particular business; and in a good or bad sense. He
                            behaves well or will.

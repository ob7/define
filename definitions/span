[1]span

   SPAN, n. [This word is formed on the root of bend, L. pando. The
   primary sense is to strain, stretch, extend, hence to join a team.]

   1. The space from the end of the thumb to the end of the little finger
   when extended; nine inches; the eighth of a fathom.

   2. A short space of time. Life's but a span; I'll every inch enjoy.

   3. A span of horses, consists of two of nearly the same color, and
   otherwise nearly alike, which are usually harness side by side. The
   word signifies properly the same as yoke, when applied to horned
   cattle, from buckling or fastening together. But in America, span
   always implies resemblance in color at least; it being an object of
   ambition with gentlemen and with teamters to unite two horses abreast
   that are alike.

   4. In seamen's language, a small line or cord, the middle of which is
   attached to a stay.

                                 SPAN, v.t.

   1. To measure by the hand with the fingers extended, or with the
   fingers encompassing the object; as, to span a space or distance; to
   span a cylinder.

   2. To measure. This soul doth span the world.

   SPAN, v.i. To agree in color, or in color and size; as, the horses span
                            well. [New England.]

                    SPAN, pert. of spin. We now use spun.

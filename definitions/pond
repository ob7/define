   POND, n. [L. pono; pontus, the sea.]

   1. A body of stagnant water without an outlet, larger than a puddle,
   and smaller than a lake; or a like body of water with a small outlet.
   In the United States, we give this name to collections of water in the
   interior country, which are fed by springs, and from which issues a
   small stream. These ponds are often a mile or two or even more in
   length, and the current issuing from them is used to drive the wheels
   of mills and furnaces.

   2. A collection of water raised in a river by a dam, for the purpose of
   propelling mill-wheels. These artificial ponds are called mill-ponds.

                       Pond for fist. [See Fish-pond.]

     POND, v.t. [from the noun.] To make a pond; to collect in a pond by
                      stopping the current of a river.

                     POND, v.t. To ponder. [Not in use.]

[1]amercement

   AMERCEMENT, n. amers'ment. A pecuniary penalty inflicted on an offender
   at the discretion of the court. It differs from a fine, in that the
   latter is, or was originally, a fixed and certain sum prescribed by
   statute for an offense; but an amercement is arbitrary. Hence the
   practice of affeering. [See Affeer.] But in America, the word fine is
   now used for a pecuniary penalty which is uncertain; and it is common
   in statutes, to enact that an offender shall be fined, at the
   discretion of the court. In England also, fines are now usually
   discretionary. Thus the word fine has, in a measure, superseded the use
   of amercement. This word, in old books, is written amerciament.

   Amercement royal is a penalty imposed on an officer for a misdemeanor
   in his office.

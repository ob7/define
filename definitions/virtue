[1]virtue

   VIRTUE, n. vur'tu. [L. virtus, from vireo, or its root. See Worth.] The
   radical sense is strength, from straining, stretching, extending. This
   is the primary sense of L. vir, a man.]

   1. Strength; that substance or quality of physical bodies, by which
   they act and produce effects on other bodies. In this literal and
   proper sense, we speak of the virtue or virtues of plants in medicine,
   and the virtues of drugs. In decoctions, the virtues of plants are
   extracted. By long standing in the open air, the virtues are lost.

   2. Bravery valor. This was the predominant signification of virtus
   among the Romans.

   Trust to thy single virtue.

   [This sense is nearly or quite obsolete.]

   3. Moral goodness; the practice of moral duties and the abstaining from
   vice, or a conformity of life and conversation to the moral law. In
   this sense, virtue may be, and in many instances must be, distinguished
   from religion. The practice of moral duties merely from motives of
   convenience, or from compulsion, or from regard to reputation, is
   virtue, as distinct from religion. The practice of moral duties from
   sincere love to God and his laws, is virtue and religion. In this sense
   it is true,

   That virtue only makes our bliss below.

   Virtue is nothing but voluntary obedience to truth.

   4. A particular moral excellence; as the virtue of temperance, of
   chastity, of charity.

   Remember all his virtues.

   5. Acting power; something efficacious.

   Jesus, knowing that virtue had gone out of him, turned - Mark 3.

   6. Secret agency; efficacy without visible or material action.

   She moves the body which she doth possess,

   Yet no part toucheth, but by virtue's touch.

   7. Excellence; or that which constitutes value and merit.

   - Terence, who thought the sole grace and virtue of their fable, the
   sticking in of sentences.

   8. One of the orders of the celestial hierarchy.

   Thrones, dominations, princedoms, virtues, powers.

   9. Efficacy; power.

   He used to travel through Greece by virtue of this fable, which
   procured him reception in all the towns.

   10. Legal efficacy or power; authority. A man administers the laws by
   virtue of a commission.

   In virtue, in consequence; by the efficacy or authority.

   This they shall attain, partly in virtue of the promise of God, and
   partly in virtue of piety.

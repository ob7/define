[1]mercy-seat

   MER'CY-SEAT, n. The propitiatory; the covering of the ark of the
   covenant among the Jews. This was of gold, and its ends were fixed to
   two cherubs, whose wings extended forward, and formed a kind of throne
   for the majesty of God, who is represented in Scripture as sitting
   between the cherubs. It was from this seat that God gave his oracles to
   Moses, or to the high priest who consulted him.

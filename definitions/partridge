   arranges the partridge and quail in a genus under the name of Perdix,
   and assigns the grous to the genus Tetrao. The partridge is esteemed a
   great delicacy at the table.

   in New England, a peculiar species of Perdix; in New England it is
   applied to the ruffed grous, a species of Tetrao.

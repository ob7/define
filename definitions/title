   TI'TLE, n. [L. titulus. This may belong to the family of Gr. to set or
   put.]

   1. An inscription put over any thing as a name by which it is known.

   2. The inscription in the beginning of a book, containing the subject
   of the work, and sometimes the author's name.

   3. In the civil and canon laws, a chapter or division of a book.

   4. An appellation of dignity, distinction or pre-eminence given to
   persons; as duke, marquis and the like.

   5. A name; an appellation.

   Ill worthy I such title should belong

   To me transgressor.

   6. Right; or that which constitutes a just cause of exclusive
   possession; that which is the foundation of ownership; as a good title
   to an estate; or an imperfect title. The lowest degree of title is
   naked possession, and lastly the right of property, all which united
   complete the title.

   But possession is not essential to a complete title. A title to
   personal property may be acquired by occupancy. A claim is not a title.

   7. The instrument which is evidence of a right.

   8. In the canon law, that by which a beneficiary holds a benefice. This
   is true and valid, or colorable. A valid title gives a right to the
   benefice. A colorable title appears to be valid, but is not.

   9. In ancient church records, a church to which a priest was ordained,
   and where he was to reside.

                 TI'TLE, v.t. To name; to call; to entitle.

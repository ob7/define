[1]income

   IN'COME, n. in'cum. [in and come.] That gain which proceeds from labor,
   business or property of any kind; the produce of a farm; the rent of
   houses; the proceeds of professional business; the profits of commerce
   or of occupation; the interest of money or stock in funds. Income is
   often used synonymously with revenue, but income is more generally
   applied to the gain of private persons, and revenue to that of a
   sovereign or of a state. We speak of the annual income of a gentleman,
   and the annual revenue of the state.

   1. A coming in; admission; introduction. [Not in use.]

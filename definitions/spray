[1]spray

   SPRAY, n. [probably allied to sprig. The radical sense is a shoot.]

   1. A small shoot or branch; or the extremity of a branch. Hence in
   England, spray faggots are bundles of small branches, used as fuel.

   2. Among seamen, the water that is driven from the top of a wave in a
   storm, which spreads and flies in small particles. It differs from
   spoon-drift; as spray is only occasional, whereas spoon-drift flies
   continually along the surface of the sea.

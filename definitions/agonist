[1]agonist

   AG'ONIST, n. One who contends for the prize in public games. Milton has
   used Agonistes in this sense, and so called his tragedy, from the
   similitude of Sampson's exertions, in slaying the Philistines, to prize
   fighting. In church history, the disciples of Donatus are called
   agonistics.

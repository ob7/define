[1]ante

   AN'TE. A Latin preposition, Gr.; much used in the composition of
   English words, especially in words from the Latin and Greek languages.
   It signifies before in place, in front; hence opposite, contrary; and
   figuratively, before in time. The Latin ante is generally used in the
   sense of before, and the Greek, in that of opposite, or in the place
   of.

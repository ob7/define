[1]atlantis

   ATLAN'TIS, n. An isle mentioned by the ancients, situated west of
   Gades, or Cadiz, on the strait of Gibraltar. The poets mention two
   isles and call them Hesperides, western isles, and Elysian fields.
   Authors are not agreed whether these isles were the Canaries, or some
   other isles, or the continent of America.

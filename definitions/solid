[1]solid

   SOL'ID, a. [L, solidus; from the sense to setting or pressure, and
   hence allied to L. solum, Eng. sill.]

   1. Hard; firm; compact; having its constituent particles so close or
   dense as to resist the impression or penetration of other bodies. Hence
   solid bodies are not penetrable, not are the parts moveable and easily
   displaced like those of fluids. Solid is opposed to fluid and liquid.

   2. Not hollow; full of matter; as a solid globe or cone, as
   distinguished from a hollow one.

   3. Having all the gemetrical dimensions; cubic; as, a solid foot
   contains 1728 solid inhes. [In this sense, cubic is not generally
   used.]

   4. Firm; compact; strong; as a solid pier; a solid pile; a solid wall.

   5. Sound; not weakly; as a solid constitution of body. [Sound is more
   generally used.]

   6. Real; sound; valid; true; just; not empty or fallacious. Wise men
   seek solid reasons for their opinions.

   7. Grave; profound; not light, trifling or superficial. These wanting
   wit, affect gravity, and go by the name of solid men.

   8. In botany, of a fleshy, uniform, undivided substance, as a bulb or
   root; not spungy or hollow within, as a stem.

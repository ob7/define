   DUE, a. Du. [L., Gr., to bind. It has no connection with owe.]

   1. Owed; that ought to be paid or done to another. That is due from me
   to another which contract, justice or propriety requires me to pay, and
   which he may justly claim as his right. Reverence is due to the
   creator; civility is due from one man to another. Money is due at the
   expiration of the credit given, or at the period promised.

   2. Proper; fit; appropriate; suitable; becoming; required by the
   circumstances; as, the event was celebrated with due solemnities. Men
   seldom have a due sense of their depravity.

   3. Seasonable; as, he will come in due time.

   4. Exact; proper; as, the musicians keep due time.

   5. Owing to; occasioned by. [Little used.]

   specified; as, two mails are now due.

             DUE, adv. Directly; exactly; as a due east course.

                                   DUE, n.

   1. That which is owed; that which one contracts to pay, do or perform
   to another; that which law or justice requires to be paid or done. The
   money that I contract to pay to another is his due; the service which I
   covenant to perform to another is his due; reverence to the creator is
   his due.

   2. That which office, rank, station, social relations, or established
   rules of right or decorum, require to be given, paid or done. Respect
   and obedience to parents and magistrates are their due.

   or other legal perquisites.

   4. Right; just title.

   The key of this infernal pit by due--I keep.

   1. Literally, to reach or stretch forward; used by Dryden, but this use
   is not well authorized.

   2. To hold out, as a false appearance; to offer something feigned
   instead of that which is real; to simulate, in words or actions.

   Lest willfully transgressing, he pretend

   not engaged; to pretend patriotism for the sake of gaining popular
   applause or obtaining an office.

   4. To exhibit as a cover for something hidden.

   Lest that too heavenly form, pretended

   To hellish falsehood, snare them. [Not in use.]

     PRETEND', v.t. To put in a claim, truly or falsely; to hold out the
   appearance of being, possessing or performing. A man may pretend to be
   a physician, and pretend to perform great cures. Bad men often pretend
                               to be patriots.

   STIGMATIZE, v.t.

   1. To mark with a brand; in a literal sense; as, the ancients
   stigmatized their slaves and soldiers.

   2. To set a mark of disgrace on; to disgrace with some not of reproach
   or infamy.

   To find virtue extolled and vice stigmatized--

   Sour enthusiasts affect to stigmatize the finest and most elegant
   authors, ancient and modern, as dangerous to religion.

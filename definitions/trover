[1]trover

   TRO'VER, n. Trover is properly the finding of any thing. Hence,

   1. In law, the gaining possession of any goods, whether by finding or
   by other means.

   2. An action which a man has against another who has found or obtained
   possession of any of his goods, and who refuses to deliver them on
   demand. This is called an action of trover and conversion. In this
   case, the trover or finding is an immaterial fact, but the plaintiff
   must prove his own property, and the possession and conversion of the
   goods by the defendant.

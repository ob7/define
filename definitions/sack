   SACK, n. [L. saccus. Heb. See the verb to sack.]

   1. A bag, usually a large cloth bag, used for holding and conveying
   corn, small wares, wool, cotton, hops, and the like. Gen 42.

   Sack of wool, in England, is 22 stone of 14lb. each, or 308 pounds. In
   Scotland, it is 24 stone of 16 pounds each, or 384 pounds.

   A sack of cotton, contains usually about 300lb. but it may be from 150
   to 400 pounds.

   Sack of earth, in fortification, is a canvas bag filled with earth,
   used in making retrenchments in haste.

   2. The measure of three bushels.

      SACK, n. A species of sweet wine, brought chiefly from the Canary
                                   isles.

     SACK, n. [L. sagum, whence Gr. But the word is Celtic or Teutonic.]

   Among our rude ancestors, a kind of cloak of a square form, worn over
   the shoulders and body, and fastened in from by a clasp or thorn. It
   was originally made of skin, afterwards of wool. In modern times, this
   name has been given to a woman's garment, a gown with loose plaits on
   the back; but no garment of this kind is now worn, and the word is in
   disuse. [See Varro, Strabo, Cluver, Bochart.]

                   SACK, v.t. To put in a sac or in bags.

      SACK, v.t. [From comparing this word and sack, a bag, in several
    languages, it appears that they are both from one root, and that the
    primary sense is to strain, pull, draw; hence sack, a bag, is a tie,
   that which is tied or drawn together; and sack, to pillage, is to pull,
                to strip, that is, to take away by violence.]

   To plunder or pillage, as a town or city. Rome was twice taken and
   sacked in the reign of one pope. This word is never, I believe, applied
   to the robbing of persons, or pillaging of single houses, but to the
   pillaging of towns and cities; and as towns are usually or often
   sacked, when taken by assault, the word may sometimes include the sense
   of taking by storm.

   The Romans lay under the apprehension of seeing their city sacked by a
   barbarous enemy.

     SACK, n. The pillage or plunder of a town or city; or the storm and
                   plunder of a town; as the sack of Troy.

[1]chert

   CHERT, n. In mineralogy, a subspecies of rhomboidal quartz; called also
   hornstone, petrosilex or rock flint. It is less hard than common
   quartz; its fracture usually dull and splintery, sometimes more or less
   conchoidal. It is more or less translucent, sometimes at the edges, and
   sometimes the whole mass, if thin, has the strong translucency of
   certain horns. Its colors are numerous and usually dull. It is usually
   amorphous, sometimes globular, or in nodules. It occurs often in veins,
   especially metallic, in primitive mountains.

   Chert is also applied to other minerals besides hornstone. Aikin calls
   a variety of flint, flinty chert, and the Derbyshire miners apply the
   term, black chert, to a fusible mineral, whereas the hornstone above
   described is infusible.

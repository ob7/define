[1]ivory

   I'VORY, n. [L. ebur.] The tusk of an elephant, a hard, solid substance,
   of a fine white color. This tooth is sometimes six or seven feet in
   length, hollow from the base to a certain highth, and filled with a
   compact medullary substance, seeming to contain a great number of
   glands. The ivory of Ceylon and Achem does not become yellow in
   wearing, and hence is preferred to that of Guinea.

   I'VORY, a. Consisting of ivory; as an ivory comb.

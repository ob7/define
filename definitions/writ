   WRIT, n. [from write.]

   1. That which is written. In this sense, writ is particularly applied
   to the Scriptures, or books of the Old Testament and New Testament; as
   holy writ; sacred writ.

   2. In law, precept issued from the proper authority to the sheriff, his
   deputy or other subordinate officer, commanding him to perform some
   act, as to summon a defendant into court to answer, and the like.

   In England, writs are issued from some court under seal. In some of the
   United States, writs are issued by any single judge or justice of the
   peace, in the name and by the authority of the senate.

   In some of the United States, the writ in a civil suit, contains both
   the summons and the plaintiffs declaration or cause of action set forth
   at large, and a writ is either a summons or an attachment.

   Writs are original or judicial. An original writ, in England, is issued
   from the high court of chancery. A judicial writ is issued by order of
   a court upon a special occasion, during the pendency of the suit.

   Writs are of various kinds; as writs of assize; writs of capias; writs
   of distringas, &c.

   3. A legal instrument.

        WRIT, pret. of write, is not now used. [See Write and Wrote.]

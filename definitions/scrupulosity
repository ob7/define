[1]scrupulosity

   SCRUPULOS'ITY, n. [L. scrupulositas.]

   1. The quality or state of being scrupulous; doubt; doubtfulness
   respecting some difficult point, or proceeding from the difficulty or
   delicacy of determining how to act; hence, the caution or tenderness
   arising from the fear of doing wrong or offending.

   The first sacrilege is looked upon with some horror; but when they have
   once made the breach, their scrupulosity soon retires.

   2. Nicety of doubt; or nice regard to exactness and propriety.

   So careful, even to scrupulosity, were they to keep their sabbath.

   3. Niceness; preciseness.

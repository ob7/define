[1]equip

   EQUIP', v.t.

   1. Properly, to dress; to habit. Hence, to furnish with arms, or a
   complete suit of arms, for military service. Thus we say, to equip men
   or troops for war; to equip a body of infantry or cavalry. But the word
   seems to include not only arms, but clothing, baggage, utensils, tents,
   and all the apparatus of an army, particularly when applied to a body
   of troops. Hence, to furnish with arms and warlike apparatus; as, to
   equip a regiment.

   2. To furnish with men, artillery and munitions of war, as a ship.
   Hence, in common language, to fit for sea; to furnish with whatever is
   necessary for a voyage.

   PEG, n. [This is probably from the root of L.pango, pactus; Gr.
   denoting that which fastens, or allied to beak and picket.]

   1. A small pointed piece of wood used in fastening boards or other work
   of wood, &c. It does the office of a nail. The word is applied only to
   small pieces of wood pointed; to the larger pieces thus pointed we give
   the name of pins, and pins in ship carpentry are called tree-nails or
   trenails. Coxe, in his travels in Russia, speaks of poles or beams
   fastened into the ground with pegs.

   2. The pins of an instrument on which the strings are strained.

   3. A nickname for Margaret.

                 To take a peg lower, to depress; to lower.

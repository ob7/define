   DAMASKEE'NING, n. The act or art of beautifying iron or steel, by
   engraving and inlaying it with gold or silver wire. This art partakes
   of the mosaic, of engraving, and of carving. Like the mosaic, it has
   inlaid work; like engraving, it cuts the metal into figures; and as in
   chasing, gold and silver is wrought in relievo.

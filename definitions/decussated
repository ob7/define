[1]decussated

   DECUSSATED, a. Crossed; intersected. In botany, decussated leaves and
   branches, are such as grow in pairs which alternately cross each other
   at right angles, or in a regular manner.

   In rhetoric, a decussated period is one that consists of two rising and
   two falling clauses, placed in alternate opposition to each other. For
   example, If impudence could effect as much in courts of justice, as
   insolence sometimes does in the country, Caesina would now yield to the
   impudence of Ebutius, as he then yielded to his insolent assault.

[1]ask

   'ASK, v.t. [Gr. In former times, the English word was pronounced ax, as
   in the royal style of assenting to bills in Parliament. "Be it as it is
   axed."]

   1. To request; to seek to obtain by words; to petition; with of before
   the person to whom the request is made.

   Ask counsel of God. Judges 18.

   2. To require, expect or claim.

   To whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more. Luke
   12.

   3. To interrogate, or inquire; to put a question, with a view to an
   answer.

   He is of age, ask him. John 9.

   4. To require, or make claim.

   Ask me never so much dowry. Gen. 34. Dan. 2.

   5. To claim, require or demand, as the price or value of a commodity;
   to set a price; as, what price do you ask?

   6. To require, as physically necessary.

   The exigence of a state asks a much longer time to conduct the design
   to maturity.

   This sense is nearly or entirely obsolete; ask being superseded by
   require and demand.

   7. To invite; as, to ask guests to a wedding or entertainment; ask my
   friend to step into the house.

                                 'ASK, v.i.

   1. To request or petition, followed by for; as, ask for bread; or
   without for.

   Ask and it shall be given you. Mat. 7.

   2. to inquire, or seek by request; sometimes followed by after.

   Wherefore dost thou ask after my name? Gen. 32.

   This verb can hardly be considered as strictly intransitive, for some
   person or object is always understood.

   Ask is not equivalent to demand, claim, and require, at least, in
   modern usage; much less, is it equivalent to beg and beseech. The first
   three words, demand, claim, require, imply a right or supposed right in
   the person asking, to the thing requested; and beseech implies more
   urgency, than ask. Ask and request imply no right, but suppose the
   thing desired to be a favor. The French demander is correctly rendered
   by ask, rather than by deman.

[1]theory

   THE'ORY, n. [L. theoria; Gr. to see or contemplate.]

   1. Speculation; a doctrine or scheme of things, which terminates in
   speculation or contemplation, without a view to practice. It is here
   taken in an unfavorable sense, as implying something visionary.

   2. An exposition of the general principles of any science; as the
   theory of music.

   3. The science distinguished from the art; as the theory and practice
   of medicine.

   4. The philosophical explanation of phenomena, either physical or
   moral; as Lavoisier's theory of combustion; Smith's theory of moral
   sentiments.

    Theory is distinguished from hypothesis thus; a theory is founded on
       inferences drawn from principles which have been established on
   independent evidence; a hypothesis is a proposition assumed to account
     for certain phenomena, and has no other evidence of its truth, than
       that it affords a satisfactory explanation of those phenomena.

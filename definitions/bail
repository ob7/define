   BAIL
   , v.t.

   1. To set free, deliver, or liberate from arrest and imprisonment, upon
   security given that the person bailed shall appear and answer in court.
   The word is applied to the magistrate, or the surety. The magistrate
   bails a man, when he liberates him from arrest or imprisonment, upon
   bond given with sureties. The surety bails a person, when he procures
   his release from arrest, by giving bond for his appearance.

   2. To deliver goods in trust, upon a contract, expressed or implied,
   that the trust shall be faithfully executed on the part of the bailee
   or person entrusted; as, to bail cloth to a tailor to be made into a
   garment, or to bail goods to a carrier.

   3. To free from water, as to bail a boat. This word is improperly
   written bale. The word is probably the same as bail in law, to free, or
   liberate, and signifies to throw out water, as with a bucket or shovel.

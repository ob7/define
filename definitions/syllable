[1]syllable

   SYL'LABLE, n. [L. syllaba; Gr. to comprehend, and to take.]

   1. A letter, or a combination of letters, uttered together, or at a
   single effort or impulse of the voice. A vowel may form a syllable by
   itself, as a, the definitive, or in amen; e in even; o in over, and the
   like. A syllable may also be formed of a vowel and one consonant, as in
   go, do, in, at; or a syllable may be formed by a vowel with two
   articulations, one preceding, the other following it, as in can, but,
   tun; or a syllable may consist of a combination of consonants, with one
   vowel or diphthong, as strong, short, camp, voice.

   A syllable sometimes forms a word, and is then significant, as in go,
   run, write, sun, moon. In other cases, a syllable is merely part of a
   word, and by itself is not significant. Thus ac, in active, has no
   signification.

   At least one vowel or open sound is essential to the formation of a
   syllable; hence in every word there must be as many syllables as there
   are single vowels, or single vowels and diphthongs. A word is called
   according to the number of syllables it contains, viz.

   Monosyllable, a word of one syllable.

   Dissyllable, a word of two syllables.

   Trisyllable, a word of three syllables.

   Polysyllable, a word of many syllables.

   2. A small part of a sentence or discourse; something very concise.
   This account contains not a syllable of truth.

   Before a syllable of the law of God was written.

            SYL'LABLE, v.t. To utter; to articulate. [Not used.]

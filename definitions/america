   AMER'ICA, n. [from Amerigo Vespucci, a Florentine, who pretended to
   have first discovered the western continent.]

   One of the great continents, first discovered by Sebastian Cabot, June
   11, O.S. 1498, and by Columbus, or Christoval Colon, Aug. 1, the same
   year. It extends from the eightieth degree of North, to the
   fifty-fourth degree of South Latitude; and from the thirty-fifth to the
   one hundred and fifty-sixth degree of Longitude West from Greenwich,
   being about nine thousand miles in length. Its breadth at Darien is
   narrowed to about forty-five miles, but at the northern extremity is
   nearly four thousand miles. From Darien to the North, the continent is
   called North America, and to the South, it is called South America.

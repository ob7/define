   SUCCES'SION, n. [L. successio.]

   1. A following of things in order; consecution; series of things
   following one another, either in time or place. Thus we speak of a
   succession of events in chronology, a succession of kings or bishops,
   and a succession of words or sentences.

   2. The act of succeeding or coming in the place of another; as, this
   happened after the succession of that prince to the throne. So we speak
   of the succession of heirs to the estates of their ancestors, or
   collateral succession.

   3. Lineage; an order or series of descendants.

   A long succession must ensue.

   4. The power or right of coming to the inheritance of ancestors. He
   holds the property by the title of succession.

   What people is so void of common sense,

   To vote succession from a native prince?

   BULB, n. [L. bulbus, a bulb or round root.] A round body, applied to
   many objects. But in botany, it is appropriately a bud formed under
   ground, upon or near the roots of certain herbaceous plants, which are
   hence called bulbous plants, as the tulip, onion and lily. The bulb
   under ground is what the bud is upon the stem or branches, a hybernacle
   or winter receptacle of a future plant, containing the plant in embryo,
   covered with a bark or rind, generally consisting of scales placed over
   each other, to defend the tender rudiments of the plant from cold and
   other external injuries. A bulb is scaly in the lily, solid in the
   tulip, coated in the onion, and jointed in the tuberous moschatel.

   BULB, v.i. To bulb out is to project or be protuberant. [Little used.]

[1]theism

   THE'ISM, n. [from Gr. God.] The belief or acknowledgment of the
   existence of a God, as opposed to atheism. Theism differs from deism,
   for although deism implies a belief in the existence of a God, yet it
   signifies in modern usage a denial of revelation, which theism does
   not.

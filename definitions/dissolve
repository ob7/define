   DISSOLVE, v.t. dizzolv. [L., to loose, to free.]

   1. To melt; to liquefy; to convert from a solid or fixed state to a
   fluid state, by means of heat or moisture.

   To desolve by heat, is to loosen the parts of a solid body and render
   them fluid or easily movable. Thus ice is converted into water by
   dissolution.

   To dissolve in a liquid, is to separate the parts of a solid substance,
   and cause them to mix with the fluid; or to reduce a solid substance
   into minute parts which may be sustained in that fluid. Thus water
   dissolves salt and sugar.

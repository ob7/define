[1]themselves

   THEMSELVES, a compound of them and selves, and added to they by way of
   emphasis or pointed distinction. Thus we say, they themselves have done
   the mischief; they cannot blame others. In this case, themselves is in
   the nominative case, and maybe considered as an emphatical pronoun.

   In some cases, themselves is used without they, and strands as the only
   nominative to the following verb. Themselves have done the mischief.

   This word is used also in the objective case after a verb or
   preposition. Things in themselves innocent, may under certain
   circumstances cease to be so.

   They open to themselves at length the way.

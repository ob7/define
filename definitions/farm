   F'ARM, n.

   1. A tract of land leased on rent reserved; ground let to a tenant on
   condition of his paying a certain sum annually or otherwise for the use
   of it. A farm is usually such a portion of land as is cultivated by one
   man, and includes the buildings and fences. Rents were formerly pain in
   provisions, or the produce of land; but now they are generally paid in
   money.

   This is the signification of farm in Great Britain, where most of the
   land is leased to cultivators.

   2. In the United States, a portion or tract of land, consisting usually
   of grass land, meadow, pasture, tillage and woodland, cultivated by one
   man and usually owned by him in fee. A like tract of land under lease
   is called a farm; but most cultivators are proprietors of the land, and
   called farmers.

   A tract of new land, covered with forest, if intended to be cultivated
   by one man as owner, is also called a farm. A man goes into the new
   States, or into the unsettled country, to buy a farm, that is, land for
   a farm.

   3. The state of land leased on rent reserved; a lease.

   It is great wilfulness in landlords to make any longer farms to their
   tenants.

                                 F'ARM, v.t.

   1. To lease, as land, on rent reserved; to let to a tenant on condition
   of paying rent.

   We are enforced to farm our royal realm.

   [In this sense, I believe, the word is not used in America.]

   2. To take at a certain rent or rate. [Not used in America.]

   3. To lease or let, as taxes, impost or other duties, at a certain sum
   or rate per cent. It is customary in many countries for the prince or
   government to farm the revenues, the taxes or rents, the imposts and
   excise, to individuals, who are to collect and pay them to the
   government at a certain percentage or rate per cent.

   4. To take or hire for a certain rate per cent.

   5. To cultivate land.

   To farm let, or let to farm, is to lease on rent.

   CHALLENGE, n. Literally, a calling, or crying out, the primary sense of
   many words expressing a demand, as claim. Hence appropriately,

   1. A calling upon one to fight in single combat; an invitation or
   summons, verbal or written, to decide a controversy by a duel. Hence
   the letter containing the summons is also called a challenge.

   2. A claim or demand made of a right or supposed right.

   There must be no challenge of superiority.

   3. Among hunters, the opening and crying of hounds at the first finding
   the scent of their game.

   4. In law, an exception to jurors; the claim of a party that certain
   jurors shall not sit in trial upon him or his cause; that is, a calling
   them off. The right of challenge is given both in civil and criminal
   trials, for certain causes which are supposed to disqualify a juror to
   be an impartial judge. The right of challenge extends either to the
   whole panel or array, or only to particular jurors, called a challenge
   to the polls. A principal challenge is that which the law allows
   without cause assigned. A challenge to the favor, is when the party
   alleges a special cause. In criminal cases, a prisoner may challenge
   twenty jurors, without assigning a cause. This is called a peremptory
   challenge.

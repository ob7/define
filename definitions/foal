   FOAL, n. [L. pullus; Gr. The primary sense of the verb is to shoot, to
   cast or throw, to fall. The same verb in Heb. signifies to unite, to
   fasten. The verb belongs probably to the root of Eng. fall and foul
   with a different prefix. Foal is literally a shoot, issue, or that
   which is cast, or which falls.]

   a filly.

    FOAL, v.t. To bring forth a colt or filly; to bring forth young as a
                             mare or a she-ass.

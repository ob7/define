   CONTEMPT, n. [L. See Contemn.]

   1. The act of despising; the act of viewing or considering and treating
   as mean, vile and worthless; disdain; hatred of what is mean or deemed
   vile. This word is one of the strongest expressions of a mean opinion
   which the language affords.

   Nothing, says Longinus, can be great, the contempt of which is great.

   2. The state of being despised; whence in a scriptural sense, shame,
   disgrace.

   Some shall awake to everlasting contempt. Daniel 7.

   3. In law, disobedience of the rules and orders of a court, which is a
   punishable offense.

[1]solecism

   SOL'ECISM, n.

   1. Impropriety in language, or a gross deviation from the rules of
   syntax; incongruity of words; want of correspondence or consistency. A
   barbarism may be in one word; a solecism must be of more.

   2. Any unfitness, absurdity or impropriety. Cesar, by dismissing his
   guards and retaining his power, committed a dangerous solecism in
   politics.

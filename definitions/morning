   1. The first part of the day, beginning at twelve o'clock at night and
   extending to twelve at noon. Thus we say, a star rises at one o'clock
   in the morning. In a more limited sense, morning is the time beginning
   an hour or two before sunrise, or at break of day, and extending to the
   hour of breakfast and of beginning the labors of the day. Among men of
   business in large cities, the morning extends to the hour of dining.

   2. The first or early part.

   In the morning of life, devote yourself to the service of the Most
   High.

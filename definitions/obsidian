   OBSID'IAN, n. A mineral of two kinds, translucent and transparent. The
   translucent has a velvet black color; the transparent is of a dark
   blue. These occur massive in porphyry, gneiss or granite, generally
   invested with a gray opake crust.

   The fracture of obsidian is vitreous or pearly; hence the two
   varieties, vitreous obsidian and pearlstone.

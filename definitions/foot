   Gr. to walk, to tread. Eng. verb, to tread.]

   leg which treads the earth in standing or walking, and by which the
   animal is sustained and enabled to step.

   4. The lower part; the bottom; as the foot of an account; the foot of a

   hereafter be placed on a better foot.

   [In this sense the plural is not used.]

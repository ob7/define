   IMPUTA'TION, n. The act of imputing or charging; attribution; generally
   in an ill sense; as the imputation of crimes of faults to the true
   authors of them. We are liable to the imputation or numerous sins and
   errors, to the imputation of pride, vanity and self-confidence; to the
   imputation of weakness and irresolution, or of rashness.

   1. Sometimes in a good sense.

   If I had a suit to Master Shallow, I would humor his men with the
   imputation of being near their master.

   2. Charge or attribution of evil; censure; reproach.

   Let us be careful to guard ourselves against these groundless
   imputations of our enemies, and to rise above them.

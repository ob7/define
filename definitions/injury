[1]injury

   IN'JURY, n. [L. injuria; in and jus,juris, right.]

   1. In general, any wrong or damage done to a man's person, rights,
   reputation or goods. That which impairs the soundness of the body or
   health, or gives pain, is an injury. That which impairs the mental
   faculties, is an injury. These injuries may be received by a fall or by
   other violence. Trespass, fraud, and non-fulfillment of covenants and
   contracts are injuries to rights. Slander is an injury to reputation,
   and so is cowardice and vice. Whatever impairs the quality or
   diminishes the value of goods or property, is an injury. We may receive
   injury by misfortune as well as by injustice.

   2. Mischief; detriment.

   Many times we do injury to a cause by dwelling on trifling arguments.

   3. Any diminution of that which is good, valuable or advantageous.

   CALOYERS, or CALOGERI, n. Monks of the Greek church, of three orders;
   archari, or novices; ordinary professed, or microchemi; and the more
   perfect, called megalochemi. They are also divided into cenobites, who
   are employed in reciting their offices, from midnight to sunrise;
   anchorets, who retire and live in hermitages; and recluses, who shut
   themselves up in grottos and caverns, on the mountains, and live on
   alms furnished to them by the monasteries.

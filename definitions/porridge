   POR'RIDGE,n. [L. farrago, or from porrum, a leek.]

   A kind of food made by boiling meat in water; broth.

   This mixture is usually called in America, broth or soup, but not
   porridge. With us, porridge is a mixture of meal or flour, boiled with
   water. Perhaps this distinction is not always observed.

   BAT'TEL, n. [See Battle.] In law, wager of battle, a species of trial
   for the decision of causes between parties. This species of trial is of
   high antiquity, among the rude military people of Europe. It was
   introduced into England, by William, the Norman Conqueror, and used in
   three cases only; in the court martial, or court of chivalry or honor;;
   in appeals of felony; and in issues joined upon a writ of right. The
   contest was had before the judges, on a piece of ground inclosed, and
   the combatants were bound to fight till the stars appeared, unless the
   death of one party or victory sooner decided the contest. It is no
   longer is use.

   CONCRETE, a. [L., to grow together, to grow. See Grow.]

   1. Literally, united in growth. Hence, formed by coalition of separate
   particles in one body; consistent in a mass; united in a solid form.

   The first concrete state or consistent surface of the chaos.

   2. In logic, applied to a subject; not abstract; as the whiteness of
   snow. Here whiteness is used as a concrete term, as it expresses the
   quality of snow.

   Concrete terms, while they express the quality, do also express, or
   imply, or refer to a subject to which they belong.

   A concrete number expresses or denotes a particular subject, as three
   men; but when we use a number without reference to a subject, as three,
   or five, we use the term in the abstract.

                                CONCRETE, n.

   1. A compound; a mass formed by concretion, spontaneous union or
   coalescence of separate particles of matter in one body.

   Gold is a porous concrete.

   2. In philosophy, a mass or compound body, made up of different
   ingredients; a mixed body or mass.

   Soap is a factutious concrete.

   3. In logic, a concrete term; a term that includes both the quality and
   the subject in which it exists; as nigrum, a black thing.

   CONCRETE, v.i. To unite or coalesce, as separate particles, into a mass
      or solid body, chiefly by spontaneous cohesion, or other natural
   process; as saline particles concrete into crystals; blood concretes in
    a bowl. Applied to some substances, it is equivalent to indurate; as,
        metallic matter concretes into a hard body. Applied to other
       substances, it is equivalent to congeal, thicken, inspissate,,
                  coagulate; as in the concretion of blood.

       CONCRETE, v.t. To form a mass by the cohesion or coalescence of
                             separate particles.

   DISPENSE, v.t. dispens. [L., to weigh, primarily to move; and perhaps
   the original idea of expending was to weigh off, or to distribute by
   weight.]

   1. To deal or divide out in parts or portions; to distribute. The
   steward dispenses provisions to every man, according to his directions.
   The society dispenses medicines to the poor gratuitously or at first
   cost. God dispenses his favors according to his good pleasure.

   1. To permit not to take effect; to neglect or pass by; to suspend the
   operation or application of something required, established or

   with oaths; to dispense with forms and ceremonies.

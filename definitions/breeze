   From land a gentle breeze arose at night.

   2. A shifting wind, that blows from the sea or from the land, for a
   certain time, by night or by day. Such breezes are common in the
   tropical regions, and in a good degree regular. The wind from the sea
   is called a sea breeze, and that from the land, a land breeze. In
   general, the sea breeze blows in the day time, and the land breeze at
   night. The like breezes are common, in the summer months, in the
   temperate latitudes.

   Breeze up the bay, and lead the lively morn.

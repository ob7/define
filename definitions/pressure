   PRESS'URE, n. [L. pressura.] The act of pressing or urging with force.

   1. The act of squeezing or crushing. Wine is obtained by the pressure
   of grapes.

   2. The state of being squeezed or crushed.

   3. The force of one body acting on another by weight or the continued
   application of power. Pressure is occasioned by weight or gravity, by
   the motion of bodies, by the expansion of fluids, by elasticity, &c.
   Mutual pressure may be caused by the meeting of moving bodies, or by
   the motion of one body against another at rest, and the resistance or
   elastic force of the latter. The degree of pressure is in proportion to
   the weight of the pressing body, or to the power applied, or to the
   elastic force of resisting bodies. The screw is a most powerful
   instrument of pressure. The pressure of wind on the sails of a ship is
   in proportion to its velocity.

   4. A constraining force or impulse; that which urges or compels the
   intellectual or moral faculties; as the pressure of motives on the
   mind, or of fear on the conscience.

   5. That which afflicts the body or depresses the spirits; any severe
   affliction, distress, calamity or grievance; straits, difficulties,
   embarrassments, or the distress they occasion. We speak of the pressure
   of poverty or want, the pressure of debts, the pressure of taxes, the
   pressure of afflictions or sorrow.

   My own and my people's pressures are grievous.

   To this consideration he retreats with comfort in all his pressures.

   We observe that pressure is used both for trouble or calamity, and for
   the distress it produces.

   6. Urgency; as the pressure of business.

   7. Impression; stamp; character impressed.

   All laws of books, all forms, all pressures past.

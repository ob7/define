[1]rath

   RATH, n. A hill. Obs.

   RATH, a. [See Ready.]

   Early; coming before others, or before the usual time.

   Bring the rath primrose, that forsaken dies.

   We sometimes see the word rath-ripe, early ripe; but it is obsolete or
   nearly so. In the United States, I believe it is not used at all.

   WONDROUS, a. Admirable; marvelous; such as may excite surprise and
   astonishment; strange.

   That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy
   wondrous works. Psalm 26.

   WONDROUS, adv. In a wonderful or surprising degree; as a place wondrous
    deep; you are wondrous fair; wondrous fond of peace. These phrases of

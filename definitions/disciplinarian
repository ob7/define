   DISCIPLINARIAN, a. Pertaining to discipline.

   DISCIPLINARIAN, n. One who disciplines; one versed in rules, principles
   and practice, and who teaches them with precision; particularly, one
   who instructs in military and naval tactics and maneuvers. It is
   chiefly used in the latter sense, and especially for one who is well
   versed in, or teaches with exactness, military exercises and
   evolutions.

   2. A puritan or presbyterian; so called from his rigid adherence to
   religious discipline. [I believe not now used.]

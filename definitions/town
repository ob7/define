   TOWN, n.

   1. Originally, a walled or fortified place; a collection of houses
   inclosed with walls, hedges or pickets for safety. Rahab's house was on
   the town wall. Josh. 2.

   A town that hath gates and bars. 1 Sam. 23.

   2. Any collection of houses, larger than a village. In this use the
   word is very indefinite, and a town may consist of twenty houses, or of
   twenty thousand.

   3. In England, any number of houses to which belongs a regular market,
   and which is not a city or the see of a bishop.

   A town, in modern times, is generally without walls, which is the
   circumstance that usually distinguishes it from a city.

   In the United States, the circumstance that distinguishes a town from a
   city, is generally that a city is incorporated with special privileges,
   and a town is not. But a city is often called a town.

   4. The inhabitants of a town. The town voted to send two
   representatives to the legislature, or they voted to lay a tax for
   repairing the highways.

   5. In popular usage, in America, a township; the whole territory within
   certain limits.

   6. In England,the court end of London.

   7. The inhabitants of the metropolis.

   8. The metropolis. The gentleman lives in town in winter; in summer he
   lives in the country. The same form of expression is used in regard to
   other populous towns.

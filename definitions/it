   IT, pron. [L. id.]

   1. A substitute or pronoun of the neuter gender, sometimes called
   demonstrative, and standing for any thing except males and females,
   "Keep thy heart with all diligence,for out of it are the issues of
   life." Prov. 9. Here it is the substitute for heart.

   2. It is much used as the nominative case or word to verbs called
   impersonal; as it rains; it snows. In this case,there is no determinate
   thing to which it can be referred.

   In other cases, it may be referred to matter, affair, or some other
   word. Is it come to this?

   3. Very often, it is used to introduce a sentence, preceding a verb as
   a nominative, but referring to a clause or distinct member of the
   sentence. "It is well ascertained, that the figure of the earth is an
   oblate spheroid." What is well ascertained?

   The answer will show: the figure of the earth is an oblate spheroid; it
      [that] is well ascertained. Here it represents the clause of the
   sentence,"the figure of the earth," &c. If the order of the sentence is
    inverted, the use of it is superseded. The figure of the earth is an
                 oblate spheroid; that is well ascertained.

   It, like that, is often a substitute for a sentence or clause of a
   sentence.

   4. It often begins a sentence, when a personal pronoun, or the name of
   a person, or a masculine noun follows. It is I: be not afraid. It was
   Judas who betrayed Christ. When a question is asked, it follows the
   verb; as, who was it that betrayed Christ?

   5. It is used also for the state of a person or affair.

   How is it with our general?

   6. It is used after intransitive verbs very indefinitely and sometimes
   ludicrously, but rarely in an elevated style.

   If Abraham brought all with him, it is not probable he meant to walk it
   back for his pleasure.

   The Lacedemonians, at the straits of Thermopylae, when their arms
   failed them, fought it out with nails and teeth.

   Whether the charmer sinner it, or saint it.

[1]radix

   RA'DIX, n. [L. a root.]

   1. In etymology, a primitive word from which spring other words.

   2. In logarithms, the base of any system of logarithms, or that number
   whose logarithm is unity. Thus in Briggs', or the common system of
   logarithms, the radix is 10; in Napier's, it is 2.7182818284. All other
   numbers are considered as some powers or roots of the radix, the
   exponents of which powers or roots, constitute the logarithms of those
   numbers respectively.

   3. In algebra, radix sometimes denotes the root of a finite expression,
   from which a series is derived.

   CABBAGE-TREE, n. The cabbage-palm, a species of Areca, the oleracea, a
   native of warm climates. This tree grows with a straight stem to the
   height of 170 or 200 feet. Its branches grow in a circular manner, and
   the lowermost ones spread horizontally with great regularity. The
   fibers of the leaves are used for making cordage and nets. On the top
   grows a substance called cabbage, lying in thin, snow-white, brittle
   flakes, in taste resembling an almond, but sweeter. This is boiled and
   eaten with flesh, like other vegetables. When this is cut out, the tree
   is destroyed.

[1]number

   NUM'BER, n. [Probably the radical sense is to speak, name or tell, as
   our word tell, in the other dialects, is to number. Number may be
   allied to name, as the Spaniards use nombre for name, and the French
   word written with the same letters, is number.]

   1. The designation of a unit reference to other units, or in reckoning,
   counting, enumerating; as, one is the first number; a simple number.

   2. An assemblage of two or more units. Two is a number composed of one
   and one added. Five and three added make the number eight. Number may
   be applied to any collection or multitude of units or individuals, and
   therefore is indefinite, unless defined by other words or by figures or
   signs of definite signification. Hence,

   3. More than one; many.

   Ladies are always of great use to the party they espouse, and never
   fail to win over numbers.

   4. Multitude.

   Number itself importeth not much in armies, where the men are of weak
   courage.

   5. In poetry, measure; the order and quantity of syllables constituting
   feet, which render verse musical to the ear. The harmony of verse
   consists in the proper distribution of the long and short syllables,
   with suitable pauses. In oratory, a judicious disposition of words,
   syllables and cadences constitutes a kind of measure resembling poetic
   numbers.

   6. Poetry; verse.

   I lisped in numbers, for the numbers came.

   Here the first word numbers may be taken for poetry or verse, and the
   second for measure.

   Yet shoud the Muses bid my numbers roll.

   7. In grammar, the difference of termination or form of a word, to
   express unity or plurality. The termination which denotes one or an
   individual, is the singular number; the termination that denotes two or
   more individuals or units, constitues the plural number. Hence we say,
   a noun, an adjective, a pronoun or a verb is in the singular or the
   plural number.

   8. In mathematics, number is variously distinguished. cardinal numbers
   are those which express the amount of units; as 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.
   Ordinal numbers are those which express order; as first, second, third,
   fourth, &c.

   Determinate number, is that referred to a given unit, as a ternary or
   three; an indeterminate number, is referred to unity in general, and
   called quantity.

   Homogeneal numbers, are those referred to the same units; those
   referred to different units are termed heterogeneal.

   Whole numbers, are called integers.

   A rational number, is one commensurable with unity. A number
   incommensurable with unity, is termed irrational or surd.

   A prime or primitive number, is divisible only by unity; as three,
   five, seven, &c.

   A perfect number, is that whose aliquot parts added together, make the
   whole number, as 28, whose aliquot parts, 14. 7. 4. 2. 1. make the
   number 28.

   An imperfect number, is that whose aliquot parts added together, make
   more or less than the number. This is abundant or defedtive; abundant,
   as 12, whose aliquot parts, 6. 4. 3. 2. 1. make 16; or defective, as 16
   whose aliquot parts, 8. 4. 2. 1. make 15 only.

   A square number, is the product of a number multiplied by itself; as,
   16 is the square number of four.

   A cubic number, is the product of a square number by its root; as, 27
   is the product of the square number 9 by its root 3.

   Golden number, the cycle of the moon, or revolution of 19 years, in
   which time the conjunctions, oppositions and other aspects of the moon
   are nearly the same as they were on the same days of the month 19 years
   before.

                                NUM'BER, v.t.

   1. To count; to reckon; to ascertain the units of any sum, collection
   or multitude.

   If a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be
   numbered. Genesis 8.

   2. To reckon as one of a collection or multitude.

   He was numbered with the transgressors. Isaiah 53.

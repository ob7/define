[1]eldest

   ELD'EST, a. Oldest; most advanced in age; that was born before others;
   as the eldest son or daughter. It seems to always applied to persons or
   at least to animals, and not to things. If ever applied to things, it
   must signify, that was first formed or produced, that has existed the
   longest time. But applied to things we use oldest.

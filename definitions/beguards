   BEGUARDS', n. A religious order of St. Francis in Flanders, established
   at Antwerp in 1228, and so named from St. Begghe, their patroness. They
   at first employed themselves in making linen cloth,united in bonds of
   charity, without any rule; but in 1290, they embraced that of the third
   order of St. Francis. The name has been transferred to all the other
   religious of the convent of Antwerp.

   High sauces and rich spices are brought from the Indies.

   2. In New England, culinary vegetables and roots eaten with flesh. This
   application of the word falls in nearly with the definition.

   Roots, herbs, vine-fruits, and salad-flowers - they dish up various
   ways, and find them very delicious sauce to their meats, both roasted
   and boiled, fresh and salt.

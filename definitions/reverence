[1]reverence

   REV'ERENCE, n. [L. reverentia.]

   1. Fear mingled with respect and esteem; veneration.

   When quarrels and factions are carried openly, it is a sign that the
   reverence of government is lost.

   The fear acceptable to God, is a filial fear, an awful reverence of the
   divine nature, proceeding from a just esteem of his perfections, which
   produces in us an inclination to his service and an unwillingness to
   offend him.

   Reverence is nearly equivalent to veneration, but expresses something
   less of the same emotion. It differs from awe, which is an emotion
   compounded of fear, dread or terror, with admiration of something
   great, but not necessarily implying love or affection. We feel
   reverence for a parent, and for an upright magistrate, but we stand in
   awe of a tyrant. This distinction may not always be observed.

   2. An act of respect or obeisance; a bow or courtesy. 2Sam. 9.

   3. A title of the clergy.

   4. A poetical title of a father.

   REV'ERENCE, v.t. To regard with reverence; to regard with fear mingled
   with respect and affection. We reverence superiors for their age, their
   authority and their virtues. We ought to reverence parents and upright
    judges and magistrates. We ought to reverence the Supreme Being, his
                          word and his ordinances.

   Those that I reverence, those I fear, the wise.

   They will reverence my son. Matt. 21.

   Let the wife see that she reverence her husband. Eph. 5.

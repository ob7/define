   PERSIST', v.i. [L. persisto; per and sisto, to stand or be fixed.]

   To continue steadily and firmly in the pursuit of any business or
   course commenced; to persevere. [Persist is nearly synonymous with
   persevere; but persist frequently implies more obstinacy than
   persevere, particularly in that which is evil or injurious to others.]

   If they persist in pointing their batteries against particular persons,
   no laws of war forbid the making reprisals.

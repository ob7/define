[1]concision

   CONCISION, n. [L., to cut off.] Literally, a cutting off. Hence, In
   scripture, the Jews or those who adhered to circumcision, which, after
   our Saviors death, was no longer a seal of the covenant, but a mere
   cutting of the flesh.

   Beware of dogs; beware of the concision. Philippians 3.

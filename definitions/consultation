   CONSULTATION, n.

   1. The act of consulting; deliberation of two or more persons, with a
   view to some decision.

   The chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes. Mark
   15.

   2. The persons who consult together; a number of persons seeking
   mutually each others opinions and advice; a council for deliberation;
   as, a consultation of physicians was called.

   Writ of consultation, in law, a writ awarded by a superior court, to

   Christian, to its original jurisdiction; so called because the judges
   on consultation find the prohibition ill founded.

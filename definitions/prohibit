   PROHIB'IT, v.t. [L. prohibeo; pro and habeo, to hold.]

   1. To forbid; to interdict by authority; applicable to persons or
   things, but implying authority or right. God prohibited Adam to eat of
   the fruit of a certain tree. The moral law prohibits what is wrong and
   commands what is right. We prohibit a person to do a thing, and we
   prohibit the thing to be done.

   2. To hinder; to debar; to prevent; to preclude.

   Gates of burning adamant,

   Barr'd over us, prohibit all egress.

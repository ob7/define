   YOUTH, n. Yuth. [G.]

   1. The part of life that succeeds to childhood. In a general sense,
   youth denotes the whole early part of life, from infancy to manhood;

   childhood, youth, and manhood. In this sense the word can have no
   plural.

   Those who pass their youth in vice, are justly condemned to spend their
   age in folly.

   2. A young man. In this sense it has a plural.

   Seven youths from Athens yearly sent--

   3. A young person, male or female.

   4. Young persons, collectively.

[1]mutiny

   MU'TINY, n. [L. muto, to change.] An insurrection of soldiers or seamen
   against the authority of their commanders; open resistance of officers
   or opposition to their authority. A mutiny is properly the act of
   numbers, but by statutes and orders for governing the army and navy in
   different countries, the acts which constitute mutiny are multiplied
   and defined; and acts of individuals, amounting to a resistance of the
   authority or lawful commands of officers, are declared to be mutiny.
   Any attempt to excite opposition to lawful authority, or any act of
   contempt towards officers, or disobedience of commands, is by the
   British mutiny act declared to be mutiny. Any concealment of mutinous
   acts, or neglect to attempt a suppression of them, is declared also to
   be mutiny.

   [Note-In good authors who lived a century ago, mutiny and mutinous were
   applied to insurrection and sedition in civil society. But I believe
   these words are now applied exclusively to soldiers and seamen.]

   MU'TINY, v.i. To rise against lawful authority in military and naval
   service; to excite or attempt to excite opposition to the lawful
   commands of military and naval officers; to commit some act which tends
   to bring the authority of officers into contempt, or in any way to
   promote insubordination.

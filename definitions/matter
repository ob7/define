   parts composing the substratum may not be visible or tangible.

   Matter is usually divided by philosophical writers into four kinds or
   classes; solid, liquid; aeriform, and imponderable. Solid substances
   are those whose parts firmly cohere and resist impression, as wood or
   stone; liquids have free motion among their parts, and easily yield to
   impression, as water and wine. Aeriform substances are elastic fluids,
   called vapors and gases, as air and oxygen gas. The imponderable
   substances are destitute of weight, as light, caloric, electricity, and
   magnetism.

   4. Subject; thing treated; that about which we write or speak; that
   which employs thought or excites emotion; as, this is matter of praise,
   of gratitude, or of astonishment.

   Shall be the copious matter of my song.

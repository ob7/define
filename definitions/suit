   SUIT, n. [L. sequor.] See Seek. In Law Latin, secta is from the same
   source.] Literally, a following; and so used in the old English
   statutes.

   1. Consecution; succession; series; regular order; as the same kind and
   suit of weather. [Not now so applied.]

   2. A set; a number of things used together, and in a degree necessary
   to be united, in order to answer the purpose; as a suit of curtains; a
   suit of armor; sometimes with less dependence of the particular parts
   on each other, but still united in use; as a suit of clothes; a suit of
   apartments.

   3. A set of the same kind or stamp, as a suit of cards.

   4. Retinue; a company or number of attendants or followers; attendance;
   train; as a nobleman and his suit. [This is sometimes pronounced as a
   French word, sweet; but in all its senses, this is the same word, and
   the affectation of making it French in one use and English in another,
   is improper, not to say ridiculous.]

   5. A petition; a seeking for something by petition or application.

   Many shall make suit to thee. Job 11.

   6. Solicitation of a woman in marriage; courtship.

   7. In law, an action or process for the recovery of a right or claim;
   legal application to a court for justice; prosecution of right before
   any tribunal; as a civil suit; a criminal suit; a suit in chancery.

   In England, the several suits or remedial instruments of justice, are
   distinguished into three kinds, actions personal, real, and mixed.

   8. Pursuit; prosecution; chase.

   Suit and service, in feudal law, the duty of feudatories to attend the
     courts of their lords or superiors in time of peace, and in war, to
                  follow them and perform military service.

     To bring suit, a phrase in law, denoting literally to bring secta,
    followers or witnesses to prove the plaintif's demand. The phrase is
   antiquated, or rather it has changed its signification; for to bring a
                    suit, now is to institute an action.

                   Out of suits, having no correspondence.

       Suit-covenant, in law, is a covenant to sue at a certain court.

   Suit-court, in law, the court in which tenants owe attendance to their
                                    lord.

     SUIT, v.t. To fit; to adapt; to make proper. Suit the action to the
   word. Suit the gestures to the passion to be expressed. Suit the style
                               to the subject.

   1. To become; to be fitted to.

   Ill suits his cloth the praise of railing well.

   Raise her notes to that sublime degree,

   Which suits a song of piety and thee.

   2. To dress; to clothe.

   Such a Sebastian was by brother too,

   So went he suited to his watery tomb.

   3. To please; to make content. He is well suited with his place.

     SUIT, v.i. To agree; to accord; as, to suit with; to suit to. Pity

   Give me not an office

   That suits with me so ill--

   The place itself was suiting to his care.

            [The use of with, after suit, is now most frequent.]

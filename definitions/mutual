   MU'TUAL, a. [L. mutuus, from muto, to change.]

   Reciprocal; interchanged , each acting in return or correspondence to
   the other; given and received. Mutual love is that which is entertained
   by two persons each for the other; mutual advantage is that which is
   conferred by one person or another,and received by him in return. So we
   say, mutual assistance, mutual aversion.

   And, what should most excite a mutual flame,

   Your rural cares and pleasures are the same.

   PROM'ONTORY, n. [L. promontorium; pro, forward, and mons, a mountain.]
   In geography, a high point of land or rock, projecting into the sea
   beyond the line of the coast; a head land. It differs from a cape in
   denoting high land; a cape may be a similar projection of land high or
   low.

   Like one that stands upon promontory.

   If you drink tea on a promontory that overhangs the sea, it is
   preferable to an assembly.

[1]positiveness

   POS'ITIVENESS, n. Actualness; reality of existence; not mere negation.

   The positiveness of sins of commission lies both in the habitude of the
   will and in the executed act too; the positiveness of sins of omission
   is in the habitude of the will only.

   1. Undoubting assurance; full confidence; peremptoriness; as, the man
   related the facts with positiveness. In matters of opinion,
   positiveness is not an indication of prudence.

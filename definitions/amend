   AMEND', v.t. [L. emendo, of e neg, and menda, mendum, a fault. See
   mend.]

   1. To correct; to rectify by expunging a mistake; as, to amend a law.

   2. To reform, by quitting bad habits; to make better in a moral sense;
   as, to amend our ways or our conduct.

   3. To correct; to supply a defect; to improve or make better, by some
   addition of what is wanted, as well as by expunging what is wrong, as
   to amend a bill before a legislature. Hence it is applied to the
   correction of authors, by restoring passages which had been omitted, or
   restoring the true reading.

    AMEND', v.i. To grow or become better, by reformation, or rectifying
   something wrong in manners or morals. It differs from improve, in this,
   that to amend implies something previously wrong; to improve, does not.

      AMEND', A pecuniary punishment, or fine. The amende honorable, in
   France, is an infamous punishment inflicted on traitors, parricides and
     sacrilegious persons. The offender,being led into court with a rope
     about his neck, begs pardon of his God, the court, &c. These words
   denote also a recantation in open court, or in presence of the injured
                                   person.

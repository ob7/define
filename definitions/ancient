   AN'CIENT, a. Usually pronounced most anomalously, ancient. The
   pronunciation of the first vowel ought to accord with that is
   antiquity, anger, anchor, &c. [Lt. ante, antiquus.] We usually apply
   ancient and old to things subject to gradual decay. We say, an old man,
   an ancient record; but never the old sun, old stars, an old river or
   mountain.

   1. Old; that happened or existed in former times, usually at a great
   distance of time; as, ancient authors, ancient days. Old, says Johnson,
   relates to the duration of the thing itself, as an old coat; and
   ancient to time in general, as an ancient dress. But this distinction
   is not always observed. We say, in old times, as well as ancient times;
   old customs, &c. In general, however, ancient is opposed to modern, and
   old to new, fresh or recent. When we speak of a thing that existed
   formerly, which as ceased to exist, we commonly use ancient, as ancient
   republics' ancient heroes, and not old republics, old heroes. But when
   the thing which began or existed in former times, is still in
   existence, we use either ancient or old; as, ancient statues or
   paintings, or old statues or paintings; ancient authors, or old
   authors, meaning books. But in these examples ancient seems the most
   correct, or best authorized. Some persons apply ancient to men advanced
   in years still living; but this use is not common in modern practice,
   though found in scripture.

   With the ancient is wisdom. Job.

   2. Old; that has been of long duration; as, an ancient forest; an
   ancient city.

   3. Known from ancient times; as the ancient continent, opposed to the
   new continent.

   AN'CIENT, n. Generally used in the plural, ancients. Those who lived in
                      former ages, opposed to moderns.

   1. In scripture, very old men. Also, governors, rulers, political and
   ecclesiastical.

   The Lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people. Isa.
   3. Jer. 19.

   God is called the Ancient of days from his eternal existence. Dan. 7.

   Hooker uses the word for seniors, "They were his ancients," but the use
   is not authorized.

   2. Ancient is also used for a flag or streamer, in a ship of war; and
   for an ensign or the bearer of a flag, as in Shakespeare. Cowel
   supposed the word, when used for a flag, to be a corruption of
   end-sheet, a flag at the stern. It is probably the Fr. enseigne.

   Ancient demain, in English Law, is a tenure by which all manors
   belonging to the crown, in the reign of William the Conqueror, were
   held. The numbers, names &c. of these were all entered in a book called
   Domes-day Book.

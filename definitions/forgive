   FORGIVE, v.t. forgiv'. pret. forgave; pp. forgiven. [L. remitto. See
   Give.]

   1. To pardon; to remit, as an offense or debt; to overlook an offense,
   and treat the offender as not guilty. The original and proper phrase is
   to forgive the offense, to send it away, to reject it, that is, not to
   impute it, [put it to] the offender. But by an easy transition, we also
   use the phrase, to forgive the person offending.

   Forgive us our debts.

   If we forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly father will also
   forgive you. Matt. 6.

   As savages never forget a favor, so they never forgive an injury.

   It is to be noted that pardon, like forgive, may be followed by the
   name or person, and by the offense; but remit can be followed by the
   offense only. We forgive or pardon the man, but we do not remit him.

   2. To remit as a debt, fine or penalty.

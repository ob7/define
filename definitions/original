   ORIG'INAL, n.

   1. Origin. [See Origin, with which it accords in signification.]

   2. Fountain; source; cause; that from which any thing primarily
   proceeds; that which gives existence or beginning. The apostasy is
   believed to have been the origin of moral evil. The origin of many of
   our customs is lost in antiquity. Nations, like individuals, are
   ambitious to trace their descent from an honorable origin.

                       ORIG'INAL, a. [L. orginialis.]

   1. First in order; preceding all others; as the original state of man;
   the original laws of a country; original rights or powers; the original
   question in debate.

   2. Primitive; pristine; as the original perfection of Adam.

   Original sin, as applied to Adam, was his first act of disobedience in
   eating the forbidden fruit; as applied to his posterity, it is
   understood to mean either the sin of Adam imputed to his posterity, or
   that corruption of nature, or total depravity, which has been derived
   from him in consequence of his apostasy. On this subject divines are
   not agreed.

   In strictness, original sin is an improper use of words, as sin, ex vi
   termini, implies volition and the transgression of a known rule of duty
   by a moral agent. But this application of the words has been
   established by long use, and it serves to express ideas which many wise
   and good men entertain on this subject.

   3. Having the power to originate new thoughts or combinations of
   thought; as an original genius.

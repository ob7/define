   severo,must be the same as in assevero, with the radical sense of set,
   fixed or continued. So persist is formed with per and sisto, to stand.
   Constant and continue have a like primary sense. So we say, to hold
   on.]

   To persist in any business or enterprise undertaken; to pursue steadily
   any design or course commenced; not to give over or abandon what is
   undertaken; applied alike to good and evil.

   Thrice happy, if they know

   Their happiness, and persevere upright!

      To persevere in any evil course, makes you unhappy in this life.

[1]hypostasy

   HYPOS'TASY, n. [L. hypostasis; Gr. to stand.] Properly, subsistence or
   substance. Hence it is used to denote distinct substance, or
   subsistence of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, in the Godhead, called
   by the Greek christians, three hypostases. The Latins more generally
   used persona to express the sense of hypostasis, and this is the modern
   practice. We say, the Godhead consists of three persons.

[1]albeit

   ALBE'IT, [This is supposed to be a compound of all, be and it, and is
   equivalent to admit, or grant it all.]

   Be it so; admit all that; although; notwithstanding.

   Whereas ye say, the Lord saith it, albeit I have not spoken. Ez. 8.

                       [This word is not antiquated.]

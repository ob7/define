[1]urim

   U'RIM, n. [Heb.] The Urim and Thummim, among the Israelites, signify
   lights and perfections. These were a kind of ornament belonging to the
   habit of the high priest, in virtue of which he gave oracular answers
   to the people; but what they were has not been satisfactorily
   ascertained.

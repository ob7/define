   CHARTER, n.

   1. A written instrument, executed with usual forms, given as evidence
   of a grant, contract, or whatever is done between man and man. In its
   more usual sense, it is the instrument of a grant conferring powers,
   rights and privileges, either from a king or other wovereign power, or
   from a private person, as a charter of exemption, that no person shall

   which most of the colonies in America were settled, were given by the
   king of England, and incorporated certain persons, with powers to hold

   own regulation. These were called charter-governments.

   2. Any instrument, executed with form and solemnity, bestowing rights
   or privileges.

   3. Privilege; immunity; exemption.

   My mother, Who has a charter to extol her blood, When she does praise
   me, grieves me.

[1]sandstone

   SAND'STONE, n. [sand and stone.] Sandstone is, in most cases, composed
   chiefly of grains of quartz united by a cement, calcarious, marly,
   argillaceous, or even silicious. The texture of some kinds is loose, of
   others close; the fracture is granular or earthy.

   Sandstones usually consist of the materials of older rocks, as granite,
   broken up and comminuted, and afterwards deposited again.

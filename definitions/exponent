   EXPO'NENT, n. [L. exponens; expono, to expose or set forth; ex and
   pono, to place.]

   1. In algebra, the number or figure which, placed above a root at the
   right hand, denotes how often that root is repeated, or how many
   multiplications are necessary to produce the power. Thus a[2] denotes
   the second power of the root a, or aa: a[4] denotes the fourth power.
   The figure is the exponent or index of the power.

   2. The exponent of the ratio or proportion between two numbers or
   quantities, is the quotient arising when the antecedent is divided by
   the consequent. Thus six is the exponent of the ratio of thirty to
   five.

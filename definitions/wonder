   WONDER, n. [G., Gr., to show; and hence a sight; a panic.]

   1. That emotion which is excited by novelty, or the presentation to the
   sight or mind, of something new, unusual, strange, great,
   extraordinary, or not well understood; something that arrests the
   attention by its novelty, grandeur or inexplicableness. Wonder
   expresses less than astonishment, and much less than amazement. It
   differs from admiration, in not being necessarily accompanied with
   love, esteem or approbation, nor directed to persons. But wonder
   sometimes is nearly allied to astonishment, and the exact extent of the
   meaning of such words can hardly be graduated.

   They were filled with wonder and amazement. Acts 3.

   Wonder is the effect of novelty upon ignorance.

   2. Cause of wonder; that which excites surprise; a strange thing; a
   prodigy.

   To try things oft, and never to give over, doth wonders.

   I am as a wonder to many. Psalm 71.

   3. Any thing mentioned with surprise.

   Babylon, the wonder of all tongues.

   Wonders of the world. The seven wonders of the world were the Egyptian
   pyramids, the Mausoleum erected by Artemisia, the temple of Diana at
   Ephesus, the walls and hanging gardens of Babylon, the colossus at
   Rhodes, the statue of Jupiter Olympius, and the Pharos or watch-tower
   of Alexandria.

   4. A miracle. Exodus 3.

           WONDER, v.i. To be affected by surprise or admiration.

   mortals.

   We cease to wonder at what we understand.

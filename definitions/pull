   PULL, v.t. [L. vello.]

   1. To draw; to draw towards one or to make an effort to draw. Pull
   differs from draw; we use draw when motion follows the effort, and pull
   is used in the same sense; but we may also pull forever without drawing
   or moving the thing. This distinction may not be universal. Pull is
   opposed to push.

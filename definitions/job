   JOB, n. [of unknown origin, but perhaps allied to chop, primarily to
   strike or drive.]

   1. A piece of work; any thing to be done, whether of more or less
   importance. The carpenter or mason undertakes to build a house by the
   job. The erection of Westminster bridge was a heavy job; and it was a
   great job to erect Central wharf, in Boston. The mechanic has many
   small jobs on hand.

   2. A lucrative business; an undertaking with a view to profit.

   No cheek is known to blush nor heart to throb,

   Save when they lose a question or a job.

   3. A sudden stab with a pointed instrument. [This seems to be nearly
   the original sense.]

   To do the job for one, to kill him.

            JOB, v.t. To strike or stab with a sharp instrument.

   1. To drive in a sharp pointed instrument.

    JOB, v.i. To deal in the public stocks; to buy and sell as a broker.

   The judge shall job, the bishop bite the town,

   and mighty dukes pack cards for half a crown.

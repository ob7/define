   CATHOLIC, a.

   1. Universal or general; as the Catholic church. Originally this
   epithet was given to the Christian church in general, but is now
   appropriated to the Romish church, and in strictness there is no
   Catholic church, or universal Christian communion. The epithet is
   sometimes set in opposition to heretic, sectary or schismatic.

   2. Liberal; not narrow minded, partial or bigoted; as a catholic man.

   3. Liberal; as catholic principles.

   Catholic epistles, the epistles of the apostles which are addressed to
   all the faithful, and not to a particular church.

                           CATHOLIC, n. A papist.

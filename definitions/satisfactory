   SATISFAC'TORY, a.

   1. Giving or producing satisfaction; yielding content; particularly,
   relieving the mind from doubt or uncertainty and enabling it to rest
   with confidence; as, to give a satisfactory account of any remarkable
   transaction. A judge seeks for satisfactory evidence of guilt before he
   condemns.

   2. Making amends, indemnification or recompose; causing to cease from
   claims and to rest content; atoning; as, to make satisfactory
   compensation, or a satisfactory apology for an offense.

   - A most wise and sufficient means of salvation by the satisfactory and
   meritorious death and obedience of the incarnate Son of God, Jesus
   Christ.

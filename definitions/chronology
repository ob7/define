[1]chronology

   CHRONOLOGY, n. The science of time; the method of measuring, or
   computing time by regular divisions or periods, according to the
   revolutions of the sun, or moon; of ascertaining the true periods or
   years when past events or transactions took place; and arranging them
   in their proper order according to their dates.

   If history without chronology is dark and confused; chronology without
   history is dry and insipid.

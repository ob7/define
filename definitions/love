   LOVE, v.t. luv. [L. libeo, lubeo. See Lief. The sense is probably to be
   prompt, free, willing, from leaning, advancing, or drawing forward.]

   1. In a general sense to be pleased with; to regard with affection, on
   account of some qualities which excite pleasing sensations or desire of
   gratification. We love a friend, on account of some qualities which
   give us pleasure in his society. We love a man who has done us a favor;
   in which case, gratitude enters into the composition of our affection.
   We love our parents and our children, on account of their connection
   with us, and on account of many qualities which please us. We love to
   retire to a cool shade in summer. We love a warm room in winter. we
   love to hear an eloquent advocate. The christian loves his Bible. In
   short, we love whatever gives us pleasure and delight, whether animal
   or intellectual; and if our hearts are right, we love God above all
   things, as the sum of all excellence and all the attributes which can
   communicate happiness to intelligent beings. In other words, the
   christian loves God with the love of complacency in his attributes, the
   love of benevolence towards the interest of his kingdom, and the love
   of gratitude for favors received.

   Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy
   soul, and with all thy mind -

   Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Matt. 22.

   2. To have benevolence or good will for. John 3.

                                  LOVE, n.

   1. An affection of the mind excited by beauty and worth of any kind, or
   by the qualities of an object which communicate pleasure, sensual or
   intellectual. It is opposed to hatred. Love between the sexes, is a
   compound affection, consisting of esteem, benevolence, and animal
   desire. Love is excited by pleasing qualities of any kind, as by
   kindness, benevolence, charity, and by the qualities which render
   social intercourse agreeable. In the latter case, love is ardent
   friendship, or a strong attachment springing from good will and esteem,
   and the pleasure derived from the company, civilities and kindness of
   others.

   Between certain natural relatives, love seems to be in some cases
   instinctive. Such is the love of a mother for her child, which
   manifests itself toward an infant, before any particular qualities in
   the child are unfolded. This affection is apparently as strong in
   irrational animals as in human beings.

   We speak of the love of amusements, the love of books, the love of
   money, and the love of whatever contributes to our pleasure or supposed
   profit.

   The love of God is the first duty of man, and this springs from just
   views of his attributes or excellencies of character, which afford the
   highest delight to the sanctified heart. Esteem and reverence
   constitute ingredients in this affection, and a fear of offending him
   is its inseparable effect.

   2. Courtship; chiefly in the phrase, to make love, that is, to court;
   to woo; to solicit union in marriage.

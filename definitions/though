[1]though

   THOUGH, v.i. tho.

   1. Grant; admit; allow. "If thy brother be waxen poor--thou shalt
   relieve him; yea, though he be a stranger." Grant or admit the fact
   that he is stranger, yet thou shalt relieve him. Lev.25.

   Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him. Job.13.

   That is, grant or admit that he shall slay me, yet will I trust in him.

   Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished. Prov.11.

   That is, admit the fact that the wicked unite their strength, yet this
   will not save them from punishment.

   Not that I so affirm, though so it seem.

   That is, grant that it seems so, yet I do not so affirm.

   2. Used with as.

   In the vine were three branches, and it was as though it budded.
   Gen.40.

   So we use as if; it was as if it budded; and if is gif, give. The
   appearance was like the real fact, if admitted or true.

   3. It is used in familiar language, at the end of a sentence.

   A good cause would do well though.

    This is generally or always elliptical, referring to some expression
                          preceding or understood.

   4. It is compounded with all, in although, which see.

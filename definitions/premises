   PREM'ISES, n. [L. proemissa.]

   1. In logic, the two first propositions of a syllogism, from which the
   inference or conclusion is drawn; as,

   All sinners deserve punishment;

   A B is a sinner.

   These propositions, which are the premises, being true or admitted, the
   conclusion follows, that A B deserves punishment.

   2. Propositions antecedently supposed or proved.

   While the premises stand firm, it is impossible to shake the
   conclusion.

   3. In law, land or other things mentioned in the preceding part of a
   deed.

[1]born

   BORN, pp. of bear. baurn. Brought forth, as an animal. A very useful
   distinction is observed by good authors, who, in the sense of produced
   or brought forth, write this word born; but in the sense of carried,
   write it borne. This difference of orthography renders obvious the
   difference of pronunciation.

   1. To be born, is to be produced or brought into life. "Man is born to
   trouble." A man born a prince or a beggar. It is followed by of, before
   the mother or ancestors.

   Man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble. Job.14.

   2. To be born, or born again, is to be regenerated and renewed; to
   receive spiritual life. John 3.

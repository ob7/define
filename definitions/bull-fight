   BULL'-FIGHT, n. [bull and fight.] A combat with a bull; an amusement
   among the Spaniards and Portuguese. A horseman, called a toreador or
   picador attacks a bull in a circus or inclosed arena, in presence of
   multitudes of spectators, irritating him with a spear, till the bull
   rushes upon the horseman, and perhaps dismounts the rider. After the
   bull has been tormented a long time, the horseman leaves him, and some
   persons on foot attack him and plunge darts into his neck; and at a
   signal given by the president, the barbarous sport is ended by the
   dagger of a matador.

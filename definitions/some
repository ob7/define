   SOME, a. sum.

   1. Noting a certain quantity of a thing, but indeterminate; a portion
   greater or less. Give me some bread; drink some wine; bring some water.

   2. Noting a number of persons or things, greater or less, but
   indeterminate. Some theoretical writes allege that there was a time
   when there was no such thing as society.

   3. Noting a person or thing, but not known, or not specific and
   definite. Some person, I know not who, gave me the information. Enter
   the city, and some man will direct you to the house. Most gentlemen of
   property, as some period or other of their lives, are ambitious of
   representing their country in parliament.

   4. It sometimes precedes a word of number or quantity, with the sense
   of about or near, noting want of certainty as to the specific number of
   amount, but something near it; as a village or some eighty houses; some
   two or three persons; some seventy miles distant; an object at some
   good distance.

   5. Some is often opposed to others. Some men believe one thing, and
   others another.

   6. Some is often used without a noun, and then like other adjectives,
   is a substitute for a noun. We consumed some of our provisions, and the
   rest was given to the poor. Some to the shores do fly, some to the
   woods. Your edicts some reclaim for sins, but most your life and blest
   example wins.

   7. Some is used as a termination of certain adjectives, as in handsome,
   mettlesome, blithesome, fullsome, lonesome, gladsome, gamesome. In
   these words, some has primarily the sense of little, or a certain
   degree; a little blithe or glad. But in usage, it rather indicates a
   considerable degree of the thing or quantity; as mettlesome, full of
   mettle or spirit; gladsome, very glad or joyous.

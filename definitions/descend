   DESCEND, v.i. [L. To climb.]

   1. To move or pass from a higher to a lower place; to move, come or go
   downwards; to fall; to sink; to run or flow down; applicable to any
   kind of motion or of body. We descend on the feet, on wheels, or by
   falling. A torrent descends from a mountain.

   The rains descended, and the floods came. Matt. 7.

   2. To go down, or to enter.

   He shall descend into battle and perish. Sam. 26.

   3. To come suddenly; to fall violently.

   And on the suitors let thy wrath descend.

   4. To go in; to enter.

   He, with honest meditations fed, into himself descended.

   5. To rush; to invade, as an enemy.

   The Grecian fleet descending on the town.

   6. To proceed from a source or original; to be derived. The beggar may
   descend from a prince, and the prince, from a beggar.

   7. To proceed, as from father to son; to pass from a preceding
   possessor, in the order of lineage, or according to the laws of
   succession or inheritance. Thus, an inheritance descends to the son or
   next of kin; a crown descends to the heir.

   8. To pass from general to particular considerations; as, having
   explained the general subject, we will descend to particulars.

   9. To come down from an elevated or honorable station; in a figurative
   sense. Flavius is an honorable man; he cannot descend to acts of
   meanness.

   10. In music, to fall in sound; to pass from any note to another less
   acute or shrill, or from sharp to flat.

    DESCEND, v.t. To walk, move or pass downwards on a declivity; as, to
       descend a hill; to descend an inclined plain. [But this may be
          considered as elliptical; on or along being understood.]

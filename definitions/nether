   NETHER, a. [This word is of the comparative degree; the positive occurs
   only in composition, as in beneath. It is used only in implied
   comparison, as in the nether part, the nether millstone; but we never
   say, one part is nether than another. It is not much used.]

   1. Lower; lying or being beneath or in the lower part; opposed to
   upper; as the nether millstone.

   Distorted all my nether shape thus grew transformd.

   2. In a lower place.

   3. Belonging to the regions below.

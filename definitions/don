[1]don

   DON. A title in Spain, formerly given to noblemen and gentlemen only,
   but now common to all classes. It is commonly supposed to be contracted
   from dominus, dom, and the Portuguese dono, the master or owner of any
   thing, gives some countenance to the opinion. It coincides nearly with
   Heb.: judge, ruler or lord. It was formerly used in England, and
   writter by Chaucer Dan. [See Spelman.]

   Dona, or duena, the feminine of don, is the title of a lady, in Spain
   and Portugal.

      DON, v.t. [To do on; opposed to doff.] To put on; to invest with.

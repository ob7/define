   PREJ'UDICE, n. [L. prejudicium; proe and judico.]

   1. Prejudgment; an opinion or decision of mind, formed without due
   examination of the facts or arguments which are necessary to a just and
   impartial determination. It is used in a good or bad sense. Innumerable
   are the prejudices of education; we are accustomed to believe what we
   are taught, and to receive opinions from others without examining the
   grounds by which they can be supported. A man has strong prejudices in
   favor of his country or his party, or the church in which he has been
   educated; and often our prejudices are unreasonable. A judge should
   disabuse himself of prejudice in favor of either party in a suit.

   My comfort is that their manifest prejudice to my cause will render
   their judgment of less authority.

   2. A previous bent or bias of mind for or against any person or thing;
   prepossession.

   There is an unaccountable prejudice to projectors of all kinds.

   3. Mischief; hurt; damage; injury. Violent factions are a prejudice to
   the authority of the sovereign.

   How plain this abuse is, and what prejudice it does to the
   understanding of the sacred Scriptures.

   [This is a sense of the word too well established to be condemned.]

    PREJ'UDICE, v.t. To prepossess with unexamined opinions, or opinions
    formed without due knowledge of the facts and circumstances attending
   the question; to bias the mind by hasty and incorrect notions, and give
          it an unreasonable bent to one side or other of a cause.

   Suffer not any beloved study to prejudice your mind so far as to
   despise all other learning.

   1. To obstruct or injure by prejudices, or an undue previous bias of
   the mind; or to hurt; to damage; to diminish; to impair; in a very
   general sense. The advocate who attempts to prove too much, may
   prejudice his cause.

   I am not to prejudice the cause of my fellow poets, though I abandon my
   own defense.

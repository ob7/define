[1]agreeable

   AGREE'ABLE, a.

   1. Suitable; conformable; correspondent; consistent with; as, the
   practice of virtue is agreeable to the law of God and our own nature.

   2. In pursuance of; in conformity with; as, agreeable to the order of
   the day, the house took up the report of the committee. It is not
   correctly followed by with. In this sense, some writers use agreeably,
   for agreeable, but in violation of the true principles of construction;
   for the word is an adjective or attribute, in agreement with the last
   clause of the sentence. The house took up the report of a committee,
   (which taking up was) agreeable to the order of the day. The use of
   agreeably in this sentence would pervert the sense.

   3. Pleasing, either to the mind or senses; as, agreeable manners; fruit
   agreeable to the taste.

[1]alleviation

   ALLEVIA'TION, n.

   1. The act of lightening, allaying, or extenuating; a lessening or
   mitigation.

   2. That which lessens, mitigates or makes more tolerable; as, the
   sympathy of a friend is an alleviation of grief.

   I have not wanted such alleviations of life, as friendship could
   supply. Dr. Johnson's letter to Mr. Hector.

   This use of alleviation is hardly legitimate without supplying some
   word expressing evil, as trouble, sorrow, &c.

   Without such alleviations of the cares of troubles of life.

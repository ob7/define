   FOS'SIL, a. [L. fossitis, from fodio, fossius, to dig.]

   1. Dug out of the earth; as fossil coal; fossil salt. The term fossil
   is now usually appropriated to those inorganic substances, which have
   become penetrated by earthy or metallic particles. Thus we say, fossil
   shells, fossil bones, fossil wood.

   2. That may be taken from the earth by digging.

    FOS'SIL, n. A substance dug from the earth, or penetrated with earthy
                           or metallic particles.

   Fossils are native or extraneous. Native fossils are minerals, properly
   so called, as earth, salts, combustibles and metallic bodies.
   Extraneous fossils are bodies of vegetable or animal origin
   accidentally buried in the early, as plants, shells, bones and other
   substances, many of which are petrified.

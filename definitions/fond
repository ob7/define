   FOND, a.

   Grant I may never prove so fond

   To trust man on his oath or bond.

   Fond thoughts may fall into some idle brain.

   2. Foolishly tender and loving; doting; weakly indulgent; as a fond
   mother or wife.

   3. Much pleased; loving ardently; delighted with. A child is fond of
   play; a gentleman is fond of his sports, or of his country seat. In
   present usage, fond does not always imply weakness or folly.

                                   cocker.

   The Tyrian hugs and fonds thee on her breast.

   Fond is thus used by the poets only. We now use fondle.

                                   used.]

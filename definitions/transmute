[1]transmute

   TRANSMU'TE, v.t. [L. transmuto; trans and muto, to change.]

   To change from one nature or substance into another. Water may be
   transmuted into ice, and ice into water; the juices of plants are
   transmuted into solid substances; but human skill has not been able to
   transmute lead or copper into gold.

   A holy conscience sublimates every thing; it transmutes the common
   affairs of life into acts of solemn worship to God.

   The caresses of parents and the blandishments of friends, transmute us
   into idols.

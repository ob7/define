[1]bombast

   BOM'BAST, n. Originally a stuff of soft loose texture, used to swell
   garments. Hence, high sounding words; an inflated style; fustian; a
   serious attempt, by strained description, to raise a low or familiar
   subject beyond its rank, which, instead of being sublime, never fails
   to be ridiculous.

   BOM'BAST, a. High-sounding; inflated; big without meaning.

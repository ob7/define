   HOUSE, n. hous. [L. casa; Heb. to put on, to cover.]

   1. In a general sense, a building or shed intended or used as a
   habitation or shelter for animals of any kind; but appropriately, a

   mansion or abode for any of the human species. It may be of any size
   and composed of any materials whatever, wood, stone, brick, &c.

   2. An edifice or building appropriated to the worship of God; a temple;
   a church; as the house of God.

   3. A monastery; a college; as a religious house.

   4. The manner of living; the table.

   5. In astrology, the station of a planet in the heavens, or the twelfth

   6. A family of ancestors; descendants and kindred; a race of persons

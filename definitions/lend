   LEND, v.t. pret. and pp. lent.

   1. To grant to another for temporary use, on the express or implied
   condition that the thing shall be returned; as, to lend a book; or

   2. To grant a thing to be used, on the condition that its equivalent in
   kind shall be returned; as, to lend a sum of money, or a loaf of bread.

   3. To afford; to grant; to furnish, in general; as, to lend assistance;
   to lend an ear to a discourse.

   Cato, lend me for a while they patience.

   4. To grant for temporary use, on condition of receiving a compensation
   at certain periods for the use of the thing, and an ultimate return of
   the thing, or its full value. Thus money is lent on condition of
   receiving interest for the use, and of having the principal sum
   returned at the stipulated time. Lend is correlative to borrow.

   5. To permit to use for another's benefit. A lent his name to obtain
   money from the bank.

   6. To let for hire or compensation; as, to lend a horse or gig. [This
   sense is used by Paley, and probably may be common in England. But in
   the United States, I believe, the word is never thus used, except in
   reference to money. We lend money upon interest, but never lend a coach
   or horse for a compensation. We use let.]

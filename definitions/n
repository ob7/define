[1]n

   N is the fourteenth letter of the English Alphabet, and an articulation
   formed by placing the end of the tongue against the root of the upper
   teeth. It is an imperfect mute or semi-vowel, and a nasal letter; the
   articulation being accompanied with a sound through the nose. It has
   one sound only, and after m is silent or nearly so, as in hymn and
   condemn. N, among the ancients, was a numeral letter signifying 900,
   and with a stroke over it, 9000. Among the lawyers, N. L. stood for non
   liquet, the case is not clear. In commerce, No. Is an abbreviation of
   the French nombre, and stands for number. N.S. stands for New Style.

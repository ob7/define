[1]theft

   THEFT, n. The act of stealing. In law, the private, unlawful, felonious
   taking of another person's goods or movables, with an intent to steal
   them. To constitute theft, the taking must be in private or without the
   owner's knowledge, and it must be unlawful or felonious, that is, it
   must be with a design to deprive the owner of his property privately
   and against his will. Theft differs from robbery, as the latter is a
   violent taking from the person, and of course not private.

   1. The thing stolen. Ex.22.

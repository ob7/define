   LAC, n.

   Gum-lac, so called, but improperly, not being a gum, but a resin. It is
   deposited on different species of trees in the East Indies, by an
   insect called Chermes lacca. Stick lac is the substance in its natural
   state, encrusting small twigs. When broken off and boiled in water, it
   loses its red color, and is called seed lac. When melted and reduced to
   a thin crust, it is call shell lac. United with ivory black or
   vermilion, it forms black and red sealing wax. A solution with borax,
   colored by lampblack, constitutes Indian ink. Lac dissolved in alcohol
   or other menstrua, by different methods of preparation, constitutes
   various kinds of varnishes and lackers.

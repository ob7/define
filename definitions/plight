   PLIGHT, v.t. plite. [L. plico; flecto, to bend; ligo. See Alloy and
   Ply.]

   1. To pledge; to give as security for the performance of some act; but
   never applied to property or goods. We say, he plighted his hand, his
   faith, his vows, his honor, his truth or troth. Pledge is applied to
   property as well as to word, faith, truth, honor, &c. To plight faith
   is, as it were, to deposit it in pledge for the performance of an act,
   on the non-performance of which, the pledge is forfeited.

   2. To weave; to braid.

   [This is the primary sense of the word, L. plico, but now obsolete.]

    PLIGHT, n. plite. Literally, a state of being involved, [L. plicatus,
    implicatus, implicitus;] hence, perplexity, distress, or a distressed
   state or condition; as a miserable plight. But the word by itself does
                    not ordinarily imply distress. Hence,

   1. Condition; state; and sometimes good case; as, to keep cattle in
   plight.

   In most cases, this word is now accompanied with an adjective which
   determines its signification; as bad plight; miserable or wretched
   plight; good plight.

   2. Pledge; gage.

   The Lord, whose hand must take my plight.

   3. A fold [L. plica;] a double; a plait.

   All in a silken Camus, lily white,

   Purfled upon with many a folded plight.

   4. A garment. [Not used.]

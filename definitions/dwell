[1]dwell

   DWELL, v.i. pret. dwelled, usually contracted into dwelt. [See Dally.]

   1. To abide as a permanent resident, or to inhabit for a time; to live
   in a place; to have a habitation for some time or permanence.

   God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem.
   Genesis 9.

   Dwell imports a residence of some continuance. We use abide for the
   resting of a night or an hour; but we never say, he dwelt in a place a
   day or a night. Dwell may signify a residence for life or for a much
   shorter period, but not for a day. In scripture, it denotes a residence
   of seven days during the feast of tabernacles.

   Ye shall dwell in booths seven days. Leviticus 23.

   The word was made flesh, and dwelt among us. John 1.

   2. To be in any state or condition; to continue.

   To dwell in doubtful joy.

   3. To continue; to be fixed in attention; to hang upon with fondness.

   The attentive queen dwelt on his accents.

   They stand at a distance, dwelling on his looks and language, fixed in
   amazement.

   4. To continue long; as, to dwell on a subject, in speaking, debate or
   writing; to dwell on a note in music.

   Dwell, as a verb transitive, is not used. We who dwell this wild, in
   Milton, is not a legitimate phrase.

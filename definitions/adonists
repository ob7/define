   ADO'NISTS, n. [Heb. Lord, a scriptural title of the Supreme Being.]

   Among critics, a sect or party who maintain that the Hebrew points
   ordinarily annexed to the consonants of the word Jehovah, are not the
   natural points belonging to that word, and that they do not express the
   true pronunciation of it; but that they are vowel points belonging to
   the words, Adonai and Elohim, applied to the ineffable name Jehovah,
   which the Jews were forbid to utter, and the true pronunciation of
   which was lost; they were therefore always to pronounce the word
   Adonai, instead of Jehovah.

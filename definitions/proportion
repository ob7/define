[1]proportion

   PROPORTION, n. [L.proportio; pro and portio, part or share. See
   Portion.]

   1. The comparative relation of any one thing to another. Let a man's
   exertions be in proportion to his strength.

   2. The identity or similitude of two ratios. Proportion differs from
   ratio. Ratio is the relation which determines the quantity of one thing
   from the quantity of another, without the intervention of a third. Thus
   the ratio of 5 and 10 is 2; the ratio of 8 and 16 is 2. Proportion is
   the sameness or likeness of two such relations. Thus 5 is to 10, as 8
   to 16, or A is to B, as C is to D; that is, 5 bears the same relation
   to 10, as 8 does to 16. Hence we say, such numbers are in proportion.

   Proportion, in mathematics, an equality or ratios.

   The term proportion is sometimes improperly used for ratio. The ratio
   between two quantities, is expressed by the quotient of one divided by
   the other; thus, the ratio of 10 to 5 is 2, and the ratio of 16 to 8 is
   2. These two equal ratios constitute a proportion, which is expressed
   by saying, 10 is to 5 as 16 is to 8; or more concisely, 10: 5:: 16: 8.
   [See Ratio.]

   3. In arithmetic, a rule by which, when three numbers are given, a
   fourth number is found, which bears the same relation to the third as
   the second does to the first; or a fourth number is found, bearing the
   same relation to the second as the first does to the third. The former
   is called direct, and the latter, inverse proportion.

   4. Symmetry; suitable adaptation of one part or thing to another; as
   the proportion of one limb to another in the human body; the proportion
   of the length and breadth of a room to its highth.

   Harmony, with every grace,

   Place in the fair proportions of her face.

   5. Equal or just share; as, to ascertain the proportion of profit to
   which each partner in a company is entitled.

   6. Form; size. [Little used.]

   7. The relation between unequal things of the same kind, by which their
   several parts correspond to each other with an equal augmentation and
   diminution, as in reducing and enlarging figures.

   [This more properly belongs to ratio.]

    Harmonical or musical proportion, is when, of three numbers,the first
      is to the third as the difference of the first and second to the
      difference of the second and third. Thus 2.3.6. are in harmonical
        proportion; for 2 is to 6 as 1 to 3. So also four numbers are
    harmonical, when the first is to the fourth, as the difference of the
    first and second is to the difference of the third and fourth. Thus,
              24.16.12.9. are harmonical, for 24 : 9 :: 8 : 3.

      Arithmetical and geometrical proportion. [See Progression, No.4.]

    Reciprocal proportion, an equality between a direct and a reciprocal
      ratio. Thus, 4 : 2 :: 1/3 : 1/6. [See Reciprocals, and Reciprocal
                                   ratio.]

   PROPORTION, v.t. To adjust the comparative relation of one thing or one
      part to another; as, to proportion the size of a building to its
    highth, or the thickness of a thing to its length; to proportion our
                         expenditures to our income.

   In the loss of an object, we do not proportion our grief to its real
   value, but to the value our fancies set upon it.

   1. To form with symmetry or suitableness, as the parts of the body.

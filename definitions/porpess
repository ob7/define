[1]porpess

   POR'PESS, n. In zoology, a cetaceous fish of the genus Delphinus, whose
   back is usually blackish or brown, whence it is called in Dutch,
   bruinvisch, brown fish; the body is thick towards the head, but more
   slender towards the tail, which is semi-lunar. This fish preys on other
   fish, and seeks food not only by swimming, but by rooting like a hog in
   the sand and mud, whence some persons suppose the name has been given
   to it.

   Of cetaceous fish, we met with porpesses, or as some sailors call them,
   sea-hogs.

   UNLUCK'Y, a.

   1. Unfortunate; not successful; as an unlucky man.

   2. Unfortunate; not resulting in success; as an unlucky adventure; an
   unlucky throw of dice; an unlucky game.

   [This word is usually applied to incidents in which success depends on
   single events, to games of hazard, &c. rather than to things which
   depend on a long series of events, or on the ordinary course of
   providence. Hence we say, a man is unlucky in play or in a lottery; but
   not that a farmer is unlucky in his husbandry, or a commander unlucky
   in the result of a campaign.]

   3. Unhappy; miserable; subject to frequent misfortunes.

   4. Slightly mischievous; mischievously waggish; as an unlucky boy; an
   unlucky wag.

   5. Ill omened; inauspicious.

   Haunt me not with that unlucky face.

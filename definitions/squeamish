[1]squeamish

   SQUEAMISH, a. [probably from the root of wamble.] Literally, having a
   stomach that is easily turned, or that readily nauseates any thing;
   hence, nice to excess in taste; fastidious; easily disgusted; apt to be
   offended at trifling improprieties; scrupulous.

   Quoth he, that honors very squeamish that takes a basting for a
   blemish.

   His muse is rustic, and perhaps too plain the men of squeamish taste to
   entertain.

[1]sector

   SECT'OR, n. [L. seco, to cut.]

   1. In geometry, a part of a circle comprehended between two radii and
   the arch; or a mixed triangle, formed by two radii and the arch of a
   circle.

   2. A mathematical instrument so marked with lines of sines, tangents,
   secants, chords, &c. as to fit all radii and scales, and useful in
   finding the proportion between quantities of the same kind. The sector
   is founded on the fourth proposition of the sixth book of Euclid, where
   it is proved that similar triangles have their homologous sides
   proportional.

[1]acacians

   ACA'CIANS, in Church History, were certain sects, so denominated from
   their leaders, Acacius, bishop of Cesarea, and Acacius, patriarch of
   Constantinople. Some of these maintained that the Son was only a
   similar, not the same, substance with the Father; others, that he was
   not only a distinct but a dissimilar substance.

                          LET'TER, n. [L. litera.]

   1. A mark or character, written, printed, engraved or painted; used as
   the representative of a sound, or of an articulation of the human
   organs of speech. By sounds, and articulations or closures of the
   organs, are formed syllables and words. Hence a letter is the first
   element of written language, as a simple sound is the first element of
   spoken language or speech. As sounds are audible and communicate ideas
   to others by the ear, so letters are visible representatives of sounds,
   and communicate the thoughts of others by means of the eye.

   2. A written or printed message; an epistle; a communication made by
   visible characters from one person to another at a distance.

   The style of letters ought to be free, easy and natural.

   3. The verbal expression; the literal meaning.

   We must observe the letter of the law, without doing violence to the
   reason of the law, and the intentions of the lawgiver.

   4. Type; a charter formed of metal or wood, usually of metal, and used
   in printing books.

   5. Letters, in the plural, learning; erudition; as a man of letters.

   Dead letter, a writing or precept, which is without authority or force.
   The best law may become a dead letter.

   Letter of attorney, a writing by which one person authorizes another to
   act in his stead.

   Letter of marque, a private ship commissioned or authorized by a
   government to make reprisals on the ships of another state. [See
   Marque.]

   Letters patent, or overt, open, a writing executed and sealed, by which
   power and authority are granted to a person to do some act, or enjoy
   some right; as letters patent under the seal of England.

    LET'TER, v.t. To impress or form letters on; as, to letter a book; a
                           book gilt and lettered.

   ASSI'ZES, n. [L. assideo, to sit by, of ad and sedeo, to sit.]

   1. Originally, an assembly of knights and other substantial men, with a
   bailiff or justice, in a certain place and at a certain time, for
   public business. The word was sometimes applied to the general council,
   or Wittenagemote, of England.

   2. A court in England, held in every county by special commission to
   one of the judges, who is called a justice of the assize, and empowered
   to take assizes, that is, the verdict of a jury, called the assize.

   3. A jury. In this sense the word was applied to the grand assize, for
   the trial of property, and to the petty assize, for the trial of
   possession. In Scotland, the assize consists of fifteen men, selected
   from a greater number.

   4. A writ; as an assize of novel disseisin, which is given to recover
   the possession of lands, tenements, rents, common, &c., of which the
   tenant has been lately disseised; assize of mort d'ancestor, which lies
   against an abator, who enters upon land after the death of the tenant,
   and before the heir enters; assize of darrein presentment, which lies
   against a stranger who presents a clerk to a benefice.

   5. A particular species of rents, established and not subject to be
   varied.

   6. The time or place of holding the court of assize.

   7. In a more general sense, any court of justice.

   8. A statute of regulation; an ordinance regulating the weight, measure
   and price of articles sold in market; and hence the word came to
   signify the weight, measure or price itself; as the assize of bread.

   This word is, in a certain sense, now corrupted into size, which see.

   GRAND, a. [L. grandis.]

   1. Great; but mostly in a figurative sense; illustrious; high in power
   or dignity; as a grand lord.

   2. Great; splendid; magnificent; as a grand design; a grand parade; a
   grand view or prospect.

   3. Great; principal; chief; as Satan our grand foe.

   4. Noble; sublime; lofty; conceived or expressed with great dignity; as
   a grand conception.

      In general, we apply the epithet grand to that which is great and
   elevated, or which elevates and expands our ideas. The ocean,the sky, a
     lofty tower are grand objects. But to constitute a thing grand, it
      seems necessary that it should be distinguished by some degree of
                                   beauty.

   5. Old; more advanced; as in grandfather, grandmother, that is,
   old-father; and to correspond with this relation, we use grandson,
   granddaughter, grandchild.

   PLEIADS, n. ple'yads. [L. Pleiades; Gr. to sail, as the rising of seven
   stars indicated the time of safe navigation.]

   In astronomy, a cluster of seven stars in the neck of the constellation
   Taurus. The Latins called them Vergilioe, from ver, spring, because of
   their rising about the vernal equinox.

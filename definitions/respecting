[1]respecting

   RESPECT'ING, ppr. Regarding; having regard to; relating to. This word,
   like concerning, has reference to a single word or to a sentence. In
   the sentence, "his conduct respecting us is commendable," respecting
   has reference to conduct. But when we say, "respecting a further
   appropriation of money, it is to be observed, that the resources of the
   country are inadequate," respecting has reference to the whole
   subsequent clause or sentence.

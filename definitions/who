[1]who

   WHO, pron. relative. pron. hoo. [L. Who is undoubtedly a contracted
   word in English as in Latin. See What and Wight.]

   1. Who is a pronoun relative, always referring to persons. It forms
   whose in the genitive or possessive case, answering to the L. Cujus,
   and whom in the objective or accusative case. Who, whose and whom, are
   in both numbers. Thus we say, the man or woman who was with us; the men
   or women who were with us; the men or women whom we saw.

   2. Which of many. Are you satisfied who did the mischief?

   3. It is much used in asking questions; as, who am I? Who art thou? Who
   is this? Who are these? In this case, the purpose is to obtain the name
   or designation of the person or character.

   4. It has sometimes a disjunctive sense.

   There thou tellst of kings, and who aspire; who fall, who rise, who
   triumph, who do moan.

   5. Whose is of all genders. Whose book is this?

   This question whose solution I require--

   As who should say, elliptically for as one who should say.

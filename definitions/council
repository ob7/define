[1]council

   COUNCIL, n. [L., to call, Gr. See Hold. This word is often confounded
   with counsel, with which it has no connection. Council is a collection
   or assembly.]

   1. An assembly of men summoned or convened for consultation,
   deliberation and advice.

   The chief priest and all the council sought false witness. Matthew 20.

   The kings of England were formerly assisted by a grand council or
   peers.

   The word is applicable to any body of men, appointed or convened for
   consultation and advice, in important affairs; as, a council of divines
   or clergymen, with their lay delegates; a council of war, consisting of
   the principal officers, to advise the commander in chief or admiral; a
   council of physicians, to consult and advise in difficult cases of
   disease.

   2. A body of men specially designated to advise a chief magistrate in
   the administration of the government, as in Great Britain.

   3. In some of the American states, a branch of the legislature,
   corresponding with the senate in other states, and called legislative
   council.

   4. An assembly of prelates and doctors, convened for regulating matters
   of doctrine an discipline in the church.

   5. Act of deliberation; consultation of a council.

   Common-Council of a city. In London, a court consisting of the lord
   mayor and aldermen in one house, and of representatives of the several
   wards, called common-council-men, in the other. But more generally the
   common-council is considered as the body of representatives of the
   citizens, as distinct from the mayor and aldermen. Thus in Connecticut,
   the cities are incorporated by the name of the The Mayor, Aldermen,
   Common-Council and Freemen, of the city of Hartford, New-Haven, &c.

   Ecumenical Council, in church history, a general council or assembly of
   prelates and doctors, representing the whole church; as the council of
   Nice, of Ephesus, and of Chalcedon.

   Privy Council, a select council for advising a king in the
   administration of the government.

   Aulic Council. [See Aulic.]

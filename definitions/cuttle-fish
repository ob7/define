   CUTTLE, CUTTLE-FISH, n.

   1. A genus of mollusca, called Sepia. They have small arms, with
   serrated cups, by which they lay fast hold of any thing. They have also
   two tentacula longer than the arms; the mouth is int he center of the
   arms, and is horny, and hooked like the bill of a hawk. They feed on
   sprats, lobsters and other shell-fish. They have a little bladder under
   the throat, [near the liver, Cuvier,] from which, when pursued, they
   throw out a black liquor that darkens the water, by which means they
   escape. Hence cuttle is used for a foul-mouthed fellow; one who
   blackens the character of another.

   2. A knife. [Not in use.]

   CINQUE-PORTS, n. Five havens on the eastern shore of England, towards
   France, viz. Hastings, Romney, Hythe, Dover and Sandwich. To these
   ports, Winchelsea and Rye have been added. These were anciently deemed
   of so much importance, in the defense of the kingdom against an
   invasion from France, that they received royal grants of particular
   privileges, on condition of providing a certain number of ships in war
   at their own expense. Over these is appointed a warden, and each has a
   right to send two barons to Parliament.

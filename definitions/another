[1]another

   ANOTH'ER, a. [an, or one and other.]

   1. Not the same; different; as, we have one form of government; France,
   another.

   2. One more, in addition to a former number, indefinitely; as, grant
   one request, they will ask another favor, another and another.

   3. Any other; any different person, indefinitely; as, "Let another
   praise thee and not thy own mouth." This word is often used without a
   noun, becoming a substitute for the name of the person or thing; as in
   the last example. It is also much used in opposition to one, as in the
   first and second passages cited. It is also frequently used with one,
   in a reciprocal sense; as, "love one another;" "bear one another's
   burdens;" that is, love one, or let one love another.

   DEFINITIVE, a.

   1. Limiting the extent; determinate; positive; express; as a definitive
   term.

   2. Limiting; ending; determining; final; opposed to conditional,
   provisional, or interlocutory; as a definitive sentence or decree.

     DEFINITIVE, n. In grammar, an adjective used to define or limit the
    extent of the signification of an appelative or common noun. Such are
   the Latin hic, ille, ipse; the, this and that, in English; le, la, les,
   in French; il, la, lo in Italian. Thus tree is an appellative or common
     noun; the tree, this tree, that tree, designate a particular tree,
      determinate or known. Homo signifies man; hic homo, ille homo, a
    particular man, &c. But in some languages, the definitives have lost
   their original use, in a great degree; as in the Greek and French. Thus
   La force de la vertu, must be rendered in English, the force of virtue,
   not the force of the virtue. The first la is a definitive; the last has
                            no definitive effect.

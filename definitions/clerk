[1]clerk

   CLERK, n.

   1. A clergyman, or ecclesiastic; a man in holy orders.

   2. A man that can read.

   Everyone that could read--being accounted a clerk.

   3. A man of letters; a scholar.

   The foregoing significations are found in the English laws, and
   histories of the church; as in the rude ages of the church, learning
   was chiefly confined to the clergy. In modern usage.

   4. A writer; one who is employed in the use of the pen, in an office
   public or private, for keeping records, and accounts; as the clerk of a
   court. In some cases clerk is synonymous with secretary; but not
   always. A clerk is always an officer subordinate to a higher officer,
   board, corporation or person; whereas, a secretary may be either a
   subordinate officer, or the head of an office or department.

   5. A layman who is the reader of responses in church service.

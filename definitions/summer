   SUM'MER, n. One who casts up an account.

   SUM'MER, n. With us, the season of the year comprehended in the months
   June, July and August; during which time, the sun being north of the
   equator, shines more directly upon this part of the earth, which,
   together with the increased length of the days, renders this the
   hottest period of the year. In latitudes south of the equator, just the
   opposite takes place, or it is summer there when it is winter here.

   The entire year is also sometimes divided into summer and winter, the
   former signifying the warmer and the latter the colder part of the
   year.

              SUM'MER, v.i. To pass the summer or warm season.

   The fowls shall summer upon them. Is.18.

                 SUM'MER, v.t. To keep warm. [Little used.]

                                 SUM'MER, n.

   1. A large stone, the first that is laid over columns and pilasters,
   beginning to make a cross vault; or a stone laid over a column, and
   hollowed to receive the first haunce of a platband.

   2. A large timber supported on two stone piers or posts, serving as a
   lintel to a door or window, &c.

   3. A large timber or beam laid as a central floor timber, inserted into
   the girders, and receiving the ends of the joists and supporting them.
   This timber is seen in old buildings in America and in France. In
   America, it is wholly laid aside. It is called in England summer-tree.

   SALT, n. [Gr.; L. The radical sense is probably pungent, and if s is
   radical, the word belongs to the root of L. salio; but this is
   uncertain.]

   1. Common salt is the muriate of soda, a substance used for seasoning
   certain kinds of food, and for the preservation of meat, &c. It is
   found native in the earth, or it is produced by evaporation and
   crystallization from water impregnated with saline particles.

   2. In chimistry, a body compounded of an acid united to some base,
   which may be either an alkali, an earth, or a metallic oxyd.
   Accordingly, salts are alkaline, earthy, or metallic. Many compounds of
   this kind, of which common salt, (muriate of soda,) is the most
   distinguished, exist in nature; but most of these, together with many
   others not known in nature, have been formed by the artificial
   combination of their elements. Their entire number exceeds 2000. When
   the acid and base mutually saturate each other, so that the individual
   properties of each are lost, the compound is a neutral salt; when the
   acid predominates, it is a super salt; and when the base predominates,
   it is a sub salt. Thus we have a subcarbonate, a carbonate, and a
   supercarbonate of potash.

   3. Taste; sapor; smack.

   We have some salt of our youth in us.

   4. Wit; poignancy; as Attic salt.

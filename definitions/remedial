[1]remedial

   REME'DIAL, a. [L. remedialis.] Affording a remedy; intended for a
   remedy, or for the removal of an evil.

   The remedial part of law is so necessary a consequence of the
   declaratory and directory, that laws without it must be very vague and
   imperfect. Statutes are declaratory of remedial.

[1]absolve

   ABSOLVE', v.t. abzolv', [L. absolvo, from ab and solvo, to loose or
   release; to absolve, to finish; Heb. to loose or loosen. See Solve.]

   To set free or release from some obligation, debt or responsibility; or
   from that which subjects a person to a burden or penalty; as to absolve
   a person from a promise; to absolve an offender, which amounts to an
   acquittal and remission of his punishment. Hence, in the civil law, the
   word was used for acquit; and in the canon law, for forgive, or a
   sentence of

    remission. In ordinary language, its sense is to set free or release
    from an engagement. Formerly, good writers used the word in the sense
      of finish, accomplish; as to absolve work, in Milton; but in this
                       sense, it seems to be obsolete.

   DENSITY, n.

   1. Closeness of constituent parts; compactness. Density is opposed to
   rarity; and in philosophy, the density of a body indicates the quantity
   of matter contained in it, under a given bulk. If a body of equal bulk
   with another is of double the density, it contains double the quantity
   of matter.

   2. Thickness; as the density of fog.

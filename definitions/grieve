   grieves a parent like the conduct of a profligate child.

   children of men. Lam.3.

   3. To make sorrowful; to excite regret in.

   Grieve not the holy Spirit of God. Eph.4.

   GRIEVE, v.i. To feel pain of mind or heart; to be in pain on account of
      an evil; to sorrow; to mourn. We grieve at the loss of friends or
   property. We grieve at the misfortunes of others. We grieve for our own
    misfortunes, follies and vices, as well as for those of our children.

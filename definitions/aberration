   ABERRA'TION, n. [L. aberratio.]

   1. The act of wandering from the right way; deviation from truth or
   moral rectitude; deviation from a strait line.

   2. In astronomy, a small apparent motion of the fixed stars, occasioned
   by the progressive motion of light and the earth's annual motion in its
   orbit. By this, they sometimes appear twenty seconds distant from their
   true situation.

   3. In optics, a deviation in the rays of light when inflected by a lens
   or speculum, by which they are prevented from uniting in the same
   point. It is occasioned by the figure of the glass, or by the unequal
   refrangibility of the rays of light.

   Crown of aberration, a luminous circle surrounding the disk of the sun,
   depending on the aberration of its rays, by which its apparent diameter
   is enlarged.

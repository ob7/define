   LO'DE-STONE, n. [from the verb to lead, and stone.]

   1. A magnet, an ore of iron; a stone found in iron mines, of a dark or
   black lead color, and of considerable hardness and weight. It attracts
   iron filings, and communicates to iron the same property of attraction.
   But its peculiar value consists in its communicating to a needle the
   property of taking a direction to the north and south, a property of
   inestimable utility in navigation and surveying.

   2. A name given by Cornish miners to a species of stones, called also
   tin-stones; a compound of stones and sand, of different kinds and
   colors.

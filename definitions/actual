   1. Real or effective, or that exists truly and absolutely; as, actual
   heat, opposed to that, which is virtual or potential; actual cautery,
   or the burning by a red-hot iron, opposed to a cautery or caustic
   application, that may produce the same effect upon the body by a
   different process.

   2. Existing in act; real; in opposition to speculative, or existing in
   theory only; as an actual crime.

   3. In theology, actual sin is that which is committed by a person

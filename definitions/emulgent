[1]emulgent

   EMULG'ENT, a. [L. emulgeo; e and mulgeo, to milk out.]

   Milking or draining out. In anatomy, the emulgent or renal arteries are
   those which supply the kidneys with blood, being sometimes single,
   sometimes double. The emulgent veins return the blood, after the urine
   is secreted. This the ancients considered as a milking or straining of
   the serum whence the name.

   EMULG'ENT, n. An emulgent vessel.

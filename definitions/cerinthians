[1]cerinthians

   CERINTHIANS, n. A set of heretics, so called from Cerinthus, one of the
   first heresiarchs in the church. They denied the divinity of Christ,
   but they held that, in his baptism, a celestial virtue descended on him
   in the form of a dove, by means of which he was consecrated by the Holy
   Spirit and made Christ.

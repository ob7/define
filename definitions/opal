[1]opal

   O'PAL, n. [L. opalus or opalum.] A stone of the silicious genus, and of
   several varieties. It is one of the most beautiful of this genus, by
   reason of its changeableness of color by reflection and refraction.
   Kirwan distributes opals into four families, opal, semi-opal, pitch
   stone [pechstein,] and ligniform. Jameson divides opal into seven
   kinds.

   Opal is a subspecies of indivisible quartz.

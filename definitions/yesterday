[1]yesterday

   YESTERDAY, n. [See Yester.]

   1. The day last past; the day next before the present.

   All our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death.

   We are but of yesterday, and know nothing. Job 8.

   2. Yesterday is used generally without a preposition; as, I went to
   town yesterday. Yesterday we received letters from our friends. In this
   ease, a preposition is understood; as on yesterday, or during
   yesterday. The word may be considered as adverbially used.

   SIGH, v.t.

   1. To lament; to mourn. Ages to come and men unborn Shall bless her
   name and sigh her fate.

   2. To express by sighs. The gentle swain-sighs back her grief.

     SIGH, n. A single deep respiration; a long breath; the inhaling of
   larger quantity of air than usual, and the sudden emission of it. This
      is an effort of nature to dilate the lungs and give vigor to the
   circulation of the blood, when the action of the heart and arteries is
       languid from grief, depression of spirits, weakness or want of
         exercise. Hence sighs are indications of grief of debility.

   DIVERSION, n. [L., to divert.]

   1. The act of turning aside from any course; as the diversion of a
   stream from its usual channel; the diversion of a purpose to another
   object; the diversion of the mind from business or study.

   2. That which diverts; that which turns or draws the mind from care,
   business or study, and thus relaxes and amuses; sport; play; pastime;
   whatever unbends the mind; as the diversion of youth. Works of wit and
   humor furnish an agreeable diversion to the studious.

   3. In war, the act of drawing the attention and force of an enemy from
   the point where the principal attack is to be made, as by an attack or
   alarm on one wing of an army, when the other wing or center is intended
   for the principal attack. The enemy, if deceived, is thus induced to
   withdraw a part of his force from the part where his foe intends to
   make the main impression.

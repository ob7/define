   GAL'AXY, n. [Gr. milk; fair.]

   1. The milky way; that long, white, luminous track which seems to
   encompass the heavens like a girdle. This luminous appearance is found
   by the telescope to be occasioned by a multitude of stars, so small as
   not to be distinguished by the naked eye.

   2. An assemblage of splendid persons or things.

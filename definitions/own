   OWN, a. [See Owe and Ought.]

   1. Belonging to; possessed; peculiar; usually expressing property with
   emphasis, or in express exclusion of others. It follows my, your, his,
   their, thy, her. God created man in his own image. Adam begat a son in
   his own likeness. Let them fall by their own counsel. He washed us from
   our sins in his own blood.

   In the phrases, his own nations, his own country, the word own denotes
   that the person belongs to the nation or country.

   2. Own often follows a verb; as, the book is not my own, that is, my
   own book.

   3. It is used as a substitute.

   That they may dwell in a place of their own. 2Sam. 7.

   In this use, a noun cannot follow own.

   4. "He came to his own, and his own received him not," that is, his own
   nation or people; own being here used as a substitute, like many other
   adjectives.

                       OWN, v.t. [from the adjective.]

   1. To have the legal or rightful title to; to have the exclusive right
   of possession and use. A free holder in the United states owns his
   farm. Men often own land or goods which are not in their possession.

   2. To have the legal right to, without the exclusive right to use; as,
   a man owns the land in front of his farm to the middle of the highway.

   3. To acknowledge to belong to; to avow or admit that the property
   belongs to.

   When you come, find me out and own me for your son.

   4. To avow; to confess, as a fault, crime or other act; that is, to
   acknowledge that one has done the act; as, to own the faults of youth;
   to own our guilt. The man is charged with theft, but he has not owned
   it.

   5. In general, to acknowledge; to confess; to avow; to admit to be
   true; not to deny; as, to own our weakness and frailty.

   Many own the gospel of salvation more from custom than conviction.

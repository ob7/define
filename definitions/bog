   BOG, n.

   1. A quagmire covered with grass or other plants. It is defined by
   marsh, and morass, but differs from a marsh, as a part from the whole.
   Wet grounds are bogs, which are the softest and too soft to bear a man;
   marshes or fens, which are less soft, but very wet; and swamps, which
   are soft spongy land,upon the surface,but sustain man and beast, and
   are often mowed.

   2. A little elevated spot or clump of earth, in marshes and swamps,
   filled with roots and grass. [This is a common use of the word in New
   England.]

              BOG, v.t. To whelm or plunge, as in mud and mire.

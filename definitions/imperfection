[1]imperfection

   IMPERFEC'TION, n. [L. imperfectio, supra.]

   Defect; fault; the want of a part or of something necessary to complete
   a thing; equally applicable to physical or moral subjects. When fruit
   fails to come to maturity, and after it begins to decay, we denominate
   the defect, an imperfection. Laws sometimes fail of the intended
   effect, either from their imperfection, or from the imperfection of the
   administration. Men are all chargeable with imperfections, both in
   character and in conduct.

   CAMPHOR-TREE, n. The tree from which camphor is obtained. According to
   Miller, there are two sorts of trees that produce camphor; one, a
   native of Borneo, which produces the best species; the other, a native
   of Japan, which resembles the bay-tree, bearing black or purple
   berries. But the tree grows also in Sumatra. The stem is thick, the
   bark of a brownish color, and the ramification strong, close and
   extended. The, wood is soft, easily worked, and useful for domestic
   purposes. To obtain camphor, the tree is cut down, and divided into
   pieces, and the camphor taken out; it being found in small whitish
   flakes, situated perpendicularly, in irregular veins, in and near the
   center of the tree. It is then repeatedly soaked and washed in soapy
   water, to separate from it all extraneous matter. It is then passed
   through three sieves of different texture, to divide it into three
   sorts, head, belly and foot camphor. Camphor oil is camphor, before the
   operations of nature have reduced it to a concrete form; and concrete
   camphor may be reduced to oil, by the nitric acid.

   POLYG'AMY, n. [Gr. many, and marriage.] A plurality of wives or
   husbands at the same time; or the having of such plurality. When a man
   has more wives than one, or a woman more husbands than one, at the same
   time, the offender is punishable for polygamy. Such is the fact in
   christian countries. But polygamy is allowed in some countries, as in
   Turkey.

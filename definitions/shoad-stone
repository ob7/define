   SHOAD-STONE, n. A small ston, smooth, of a dark liver color with a
   shade of purple. Shoad-stoners are loose masses found at the entrances
   of mines, sometimes running in a straight line from the surface to a
   vein of ore. They appear to be broken from the strata or larger
   massess; they usually contain mundic, or marcastic matter, and a
   portion of the ore of the mine.

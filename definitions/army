   'ARMY, n.

   1. A collection or body of men armed for war, and organized in
   companies, battalions, regiments, brigades and divisions, under proper
   officers. In general, an army in modern times consists of infantry and
   cavalry, with artillery; although the union of all is not essential to
   the constitution of an army. Among savages, armies are differently
   formed.

   2. A great number; a vast multitude; as an army of locusts or
   caterpillars. Joel 2:25.

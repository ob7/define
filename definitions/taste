   2. The sense by which we perceive the relish of a thing. This sense

   variety of tastes. In the influenza of 1790, the taste, for some days,
   was entirely extinguished.

   I have no taste

   Of popular applause.

   [Note. In this use, the word is now followed by for. "He had no taste
   for glory." When followed by of, the sense is ambiguous, or rather it
   denotes experience, trial.]

   taste.

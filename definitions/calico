[1]calico

   CALICO, n. [said to be from Calicut, in India.] Cotton cloth. In
   England, white or unprinted cotton cloth is called calico. In the
   United States, calico is printed cotton cloth, having not more than two
   colors. I have never heard this name given to the unprinted cloth.
   Calico was originally imported from India, but is now manufactured in
   Europe and the United States.

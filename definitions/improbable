[1]improbable

   IMPROB'ABLE, a. [L. improbabilis; in and probabilis, from probo, to
   prove.] Not likely to be true; not to be expected under the
   circumstances of the case. It is always improbable that men will
   knowingly oppose their own interest; yet the fact is possible. It is
   improbable that snow will fall in July, but not incredible.

[1]snarl

   SN'ARL, v.i. [This word seems to be allied to gnarl, and to proceed
   from some root signifyingto twist, bind, or fasten, or to involve,
   entangle, and thus to be allied to snare.]

   1. To growl, as an angry or surly dog; to gnarl; to utter grumbling
   sounds; but it expresses more violence than grumble. That I should
   snarl and bit and play the dog.

   2. To speak roughly; to talk in rude murmuring terms. It is malicious
   and unmanly to snarl at the little lapses of a pen, from with Virgil
   himself stands not exempted.

                                SN'ARL, v.t.

   1. To entangle; to complicate; to involve in knots; as, to snarl the
   hair; to snarl a skain of thread. [This word is in universal popular
   use in New England.]

   2. To embarrass.

    SN'ARL, n. Entanglement; a knot or complication of hair, thread, &c.,
                    which it is difficult to disentangle.

   DOZEN, a. Duzn. [G.] Twelve in number, applied to things of the same
   kind, but rarely or never to that number in the abstract. We say, a
   dozen men; a dozen pair of gloves. It is a word much used in common
   discourse and in light compositions; rarely in the grave or elevated
   style.

   DOZEN, n. The number twelve of things of a like kind; as a dozen of
   eggs; twelve dozen of gloves; a dozen of wine.

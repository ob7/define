[1]felony

   FEL'ONY, n. [See Felon.] In common law, any crime which incurs the
   forfeiture of lands or goods. Treason was formerly comprised under the
   name of felony, but is now distinguished from crimes thus denominated,
   although it is really a felony. All offenses punishable with death are
   felonies; and so are some crimes not thus punished, as suicide,
   homicide by chance-medley, or in self-defense, and petty larceny.
   Capital punishment therefore does not necessarily enter into the true
   idea or definition of felony; the true criterion of felony being
   forfeiture of lands or goods. But the idea of felony has been so
   generally connected with that of capital punishment, that law and usage
   now confirm that connection. Thus if a statute makes any new offense a
   felony, it is understood to mean a crime punishable with death.

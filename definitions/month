[1]month

   MONTH, n. [L. mensis; Gr. a month, from the moon.] A space or period of
   time constituting a division of the year. Month originally signified
   the time of one revolution of the moon, a lunation, or the period from
   one change or conjunction of the moon with the sun to another, a period
   of 27 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes and 5 seconds. This is the periodical
   month, or as we generally call it, the lunar month. In this sense we
   still use the word month. But we also apply the term to the space of
   time in which the sun passes through one sign, or a twelfth part of the
   zodiac. This period contains 30 days, 10 hours, 29 minutes, 5 seconds,
   and it called a solar month. In the year, there are twelve solar
   months, and thirteen lunar months.

   In popular language, four weeks are called a month, being nearly the
   length of the lunar month. A calendar month differs in some degree from
   a solar month; consisting of twenty eight, twenty nine, thirty or
   thirty one days, as the months stand in calendars or almanacs.

   BLEACH, v.t. [Eng. bleak.]

   To whiten; to make white or whiter; to take out color; applied to many
   things, but particularly to cloth and thread. Bleaching is variously
   performed, but in general by steeping the cloth in lye, or a solution
   of pot or pearl ashes, and then exposing it to the solar rays.

   Bleaching is now generally performed, on the large scale, by means of
   chlorine or the oxymuriatic acid, which has the property of whitening
   vegetable substances.

   BLEACH, v.i. To grow white in any manner.

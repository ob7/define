   SH'ARDBORN, a. [shard and born.] Born or produced among among
   fragments, or in crevices; as the shardborn beetle.

   Johnson suggests that shard may perhaps signify the sheath of the witgs
   of insects. In this case, the word should be written shardborne, and
   defined, born in the air by sheathed wings. Such is Todd's explanation
   of the word in Shakespeare. The word shard may perhaps be used for the
   crustaceous wing of an insect, but I know not that such a sense is
   legitimate. [See Sharded.]

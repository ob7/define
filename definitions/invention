   INVEN'TION, n. [L. inventio.]

   1. The action or operation of finding out something new; the
   contrivance of that which did not before exist; as the invention of
   logarithms; the invention of the art of printing; the invention of the
   orrery. Invention differs from discovery. Invention is applied to the
   contrivance and production of something that did not before exist.
   Discovery brings to light that which existed before, but which was not
   know. We are indebted to invention for the thermometer and barometer.
   We are indebted to discovery for the knowledge of the isles in the
   Pacific ocean, and for the knowledge of galvanism, and many species of
   earth not formerly known. This distinction is important, though not
   always observed.

   2. That which is invented. The cotton gin is the invention of Whitney;
   the steam boat is the invention of Fulton. The Doric,Ionic and
   Corinthian orders are said to be inventions of the Greeks; the Tuscan
   and Composite are inventions of the Latins.

   3. Forgery; fiction. Fables are the inventions of ingenious men.

   4. In painting, the finding or choice of the objects which are to enter
   into the composition of the piece.

   5. In poetry, it is applied to whatever the poet adds to the history of
   the subject.

   6. In rhetoric, the finding and selecting of arguments to prove and
   illustrate the point in view.

   7. The power of inventing; that skill or ingenuity which is or may be
   employed in contriving any thing new. Thus we say, a man of invention.

   8. Discovery; the finding of things hidden or before unknown. [Less
   proper.]

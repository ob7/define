   COMET, n. An opake, spherical, solid body, like a planet, but
   accompanied with a train of light, performing revolutions about the
   sun, in an elliptical orbit, having the sun in one of its foci. In its
   approach to its perihelion, it becomes visible, and after passing its
   perihelion, it departs into remote regions and disappears. In popular
   language, comets are tailed, bearded or hairy, but these terms are
   taken from the appearance of the light which attends the, which, in
   different positions with respect to the sun, exhibits the form of a t
   ail or train, a beard, or a border of hair. When the comet is westward
   of the sun and rises or sets before it, the light appears in the
   morning like a train beginning at the body of the comet and extending
   westward and diverging in proportion to its extent. Thus the comet of
   1769, [which I saw,] when it rose in the morning, presented a luminous
   train that extended nearly from the horizon to the meridian. When the
   comet and the sun are opposite, the earth being between them, the comet
   is, to the view, immersed in its train and the light appears around its
   body like a fringe or border of hair. From the train of a comet, this
   body has obtained the popular name of a blazing star.

   Herschel observed several comets, which appeared to have no nucleus,
   but to be merely collections of vapor condensed about a center.

                         COMET, n. A game at cards.

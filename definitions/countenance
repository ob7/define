   COUNTENANCE, n. [L., to hold.]

   1. Literally, the contents of a body; the outline and extent which
   constitutes the whole figure or external appearance. Appropriately, the
   human face; the whole form of the face, or system of features; visage.

   A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance. Proverbs 15.

   Be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance. Matthew 6.

   2. Air; look; aspect; appearance of the face; as in the phrase, to
   change or alter the countenance.

   3. The face or look of a beast; as a horse of a good countenance.

   4. Favor; good will; kindness.

   Thou hast made him glad with thy countenance. Psalm 21.

   Hence in scriptural language, the light of Gods countenance is his
   smiles or favorable regards, his favor and grace; and to hide his face
   or countenance is to manifest his displeasure, and withdraw his
   gracious aids. So the rebuke of his countenance indicates his anger and
   frowns. Psalm 80.

   This application of face or countenance, which seems to be of high
   antiquity, proceeded probably from the practice of turning away the
   face to express anger, displeasure and refusal; a practice still
   common, but probably universal among rude nations. The opposite conduct
   would of course express favor. The grant of a petition is accompanied
   with a look directed to the petitioner; the refusal or denial, with an
   averted face. Hence,

   COMPARISON, n.

   1. The act of comparing; the act of considering the relation between
   persons or things, with a view to discover their agreement or
   resemblance, or their disagreement or difference.

   We learn to form a correct estimate of men and their actions by
   comparison.

   2. The state of being compared.

   If we rightly estimate what we call good and evil, we shall find it
   lies much in comparison.

   3. Comparative estimate; proportion.

   Who is left among you that saw this house in its first glory? And how
   do you see it now? Is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as
   nothing? Hag. 2.

   4. In grammar, the formation of an adjective in its several degrees of
   signification; as strong, stronger, strongest; greenish, green,
   greener, greenest; glorious, more glorious, most glorious. In English,
   there are strictly four degrees of comparison.

   5. A simile, similitude, or illustration by similitude.

   Whereto shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or with what comparison
   shall we compare it? Mark 4.

   6. In rhetoric, a figure by which two things are considered with regard
   to a third, which is common to them both; as, a hero is like a lion in
   courage. Here courage is common to hero and lion, and constitutes the
   point of resemblance.

   The distinction between similitude and comparison is, that the former
   has reference to the quality; the latter, to the quantity. Comparison
   is between more and less; similitude is between good and gad.
   Hannibal--hung like a tempest on the declivities of the Alps--is a
   likeness by similitude. The sublimity of the scriptural prophets
   exceeds that of Homer, as much as thunder is louder than a whisper--is
   a likeness by comparison.

   But comparison has reference to quality as well as quantity.

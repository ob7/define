   and Gr. basis; Eng. base; It. Abbassare; Sp. bare, low. See Abash.]

   down, as used by Bacon, "to abase the eye." But the word is seldom used
   in reference to material things.

   2. To cast down; to reduce low; to depress; to humble; to degrade;
   applied to the passions, rank, office, and condition in life.

   Those that walk in pride he is able to abase. Dan. 4.

   APOSIO'PESY, n. [Gr. of to be silent.]

   Reticence or suppression; as when a speaker for some cause, as fear,
   sorrow, or anger, suddenly breaks off his discourse, before it is
   ended; or speaks of a thing, when he makes a show as if he would say
   nothing on the subject; or aggravates what he pretends to conceal, by
   uttering a part and leaving the remainder to be understood.

   DEMONSTRATE, v.t. [L. To show.]

   1. To show or prove to be certain; to prove beyond the possibility of
   doubt; to prove in such a manner as to reduce the contrary position to
   evident absurdity. We demonstrate a problem in geometry, or a
   proposition in ethics, by showing that the contrary is absurd or
   impossible.

   MEN'TION, n. [L. mentio, from Gr. to put in mind; L. moneo and mind.] A
   hint; a suggestion; a brief notice or remark expressed in words or
   writing; used chiefly after make.

   Make no mention of other gods. Josh.23.

   I will make mention of thy righteousness. Ps.71.

   Without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers. Rom.1.

    MEN'TION, v.t. To speak; to name; to utter a brief remark; to state a
       particular fact, or to express it in writing. It is applied to
    something thrown in or added incidentally in a discourse or writing,
      and thus differs from the sense of relate, recite, and narrate. I
     mentioned to him a fact that fell under my own observation. In the
          course of conversation, that circumstance was mentioned.

   I will mention the loving-kindness of the Lord. Is.63.

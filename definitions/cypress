   CYPRESS, n. [L., Gr.]

   1. A genus of plants or trees. The most remarkable are the sempervirens
   or common cypress, the evergreen American cypress or white cedar, and
   the disticha or deciduous American cypress. The wood of these trees is
   remarkable for its durability. The coffins in which the Athenian heroes
   and the mummies of Egypt were deposited, are said to have been made of
   the first species.

   2 The emblem of mourning for the dead, cypress branches having been
   anciently used at funerals.

   Had success attended the Americans, the death of Warren would have been
   sufficient to damp the joys of victory, and the cypress would have been
   united with the laurel.

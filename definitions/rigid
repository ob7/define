[1]rigid

   RIG'ID, a. [Gr. to be stiff; L. frigeo, frigidus; Heb. to be still, to
   be stiff.]

   1. Stiff; not pliant; not easily bent. It is applied to bodies or
   substances that are naturally soft or flexible, but not fluid. We never
   say, a rigid stone or rigid iron, nor do we say, rigid ice; but we say,
   an animal body or limb, when cold, is rigid. Rigid is then opposed to
   flexible, but expresses less than inflexible.

   2. Strict in opinion, practice or discipline; severe in temper; opposed
   to lax or indulgent; as a rigid father or master; a rigid officer.

   3. Strict; exact; as a rigid law or rule; rigid discipline; rigid
   criticism.

   4. Severely just; as a rigid sentence or judgment.

   5. Exactly according to the sentence or law; as rigid execution.

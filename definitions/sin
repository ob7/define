   SIN, n.

   1. The voluntary departure of a moral agent from a known rule of
   rectitude or duty, prescribed by God; any voluntary transgression of
   the divine law, or violation of a divine command; a wicked act;
   iniquity. Sin is either a positive act in which a known divine law is
   violated, or it is the voluntary neglect to obey a positive divine
   command, or a rule of duty clearly implied in such command. Sin
   comprehends not action only, but neglect of known duty, all evil
   thoughts purposes, words and desires, whatever is contrary to God's
   commands or law. 1 John 3. Matt. 15. James 4. Sinner neither enjoy the
   pleasures of nor the peace of piety. Among divines, sin is original or
   actual. Actual sin, above defined, is the act of a moral agent in
   violating a known rule of duty. Original sin, as generally understood,
   is native depravity of heart to the divine will, that corruption of
   nature of deterioration of the moral character of man, which is
   supposed to be the effect of Adam's apostasy; and which manifests
   itself in moral agents by positive act of disobedience to the divine
   will, or by the voluntary neglect to comply with the express commands
   of God, which require that we should love God with all the heart and
   soul and strength and mind, and our neighbor as ourselves. This native
   depravity or alienation of affections from God and his law, is supposed
   to be what the apostle calls the carnal mind or mindedness, which is
   enmity against God, and is therefore denominated sin or sinfulness.
   Unpardonable sin, or blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, is supposed to
   be a malicious and obstinate rejection of Christ and the gospel plan of
   salvation, or a contemptuous resistance made to the influences and
   convictions of the Holy Spirit. Matt.12.

   2. A sin-offering; an offering made to atone for sin. He hath made him
   to be sin for us, who knew no sin. 2 Cor 5.

   3. A man enormously wicked. [Not in use.]

   4. Sin differs from crime, not in nature, but in application. That
   which is a crime against society, is sin against God.

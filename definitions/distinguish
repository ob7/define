   DISTINGUISH, v.t. [L. Gr. The primary sense is, to prick, to pierce
   with a sharp point, to thrust in or on; and we retain the precise word
   in the verb, to stick, which see. The practice of making marks by
   puncturing, or sticking, gave rise to the applications of this word, as
   such marks were used to note and ascertain different things, to
   distinguish them. See Distinguish.]

   1. To ascertain and indicate difference by some external mark. The
   farmer distinguishes his sheep by marking their ears. The manufacturer
   distinguishes pieces of cloth by some mark or impression.

   2. To separate one thing from another by some mark or quality; to know
   or ascertain difference.

   First, by sight; as, to distinguish ones own children from others by
   their features.

   Secondly, by feeling. A blind man distinguishes an egg from an orange,
   but rarely distinguishes colors.

   Thirdly, by smell; as, it is easy to distinguish the small of a peach
   from that of an apple.

   Fourthly, by taste; as, to distinguish a plum from a pear.

   Fifthly, by hearing; as to distinguish the sound of a drum from that of
   a violin.

   Sixthly, by the understanding; as, to distinguish vice form virtue,
   truth from falsehood.

   3. To separate or divide by any mark or quality which constitutes
   difference. We distinguish sounds into high and low, soft and harsh,
   lively and grave. We distinguish causes into direct and indirect,
   immediate and mediate.

   4. To discern critically; to judge.

   Not more can you distinguish of a man, than of his outward show.

   5. To separate from others by some mark of honor or preference. Homer
   and Virgil are distinguished as poets; Demosthenes and Cicero, as
   orators.

   6. To make eminent or known.

        DISTINGUISH, v.i. To make a distinction; to find or show the
   difference. It is the province of a judge to distinguish between cases
               apparently similar, but differing in principle.

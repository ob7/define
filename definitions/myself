[1]myself

   MYSELF', pron. A compound of my and self, used after I, to express
   emphasis, marking emphatically the distinction between the speaker and
   another person; as, I myself will do it; I have done it myself.

   1. In the objective case, the reciprocal of I. I will defend myself.

   2. It is sometimes used without I, particularly in poetry.

   Myself shall mount the rostrum in his favor.

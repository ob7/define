[1]pendulum

   PEND'ULUM, n. [L. pendulus, pendulum.] A vibrating body suspended from
   a fixed point; as the pendulum of a clock. The oscillations of a
   pendulum depend on gravity, and are always performed in nearly equal
   times, supposing the length of the pendulum and the gravity to remain
   the same.

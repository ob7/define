   COMMELINE, n. A genus of herbaceous plants, Commelina, natives of warm
   climates. This name was given to this genus by Linne, in honor of the
   Commelins, distinguished botanists of Holland. These plants have
   flowers with three petals, two large and one small; the large petals
   representing John and Gaspard Commelin, who published catalogues of
   plants; the smaller petal representing another of the name who
   published nothing.

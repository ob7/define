   PAPER-MONEY, n. Notes or bills issued by authority, and promising the
   payment of money, circulated as the representative of coin. We apply
   the word to notes or bills issued by a state or by a banking
   corporation; rarely or never to private notes or bills of exchange,
   though the latter may be included.

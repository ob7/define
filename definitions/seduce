   1. To draw aside or entice from the path of rectitude and duty in any
   manner, by flattery,

   promises, bribes or otherwise; to tempt and lead to iniquity; to
   corrupt; to deprave.

   Me the gold of France did not seduce. Shak.

   In the latter times, some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to
   seducing spirits.

                         base enough to betray her.

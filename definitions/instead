   its character of a noun, and is followed by of; instead of, in the same
   manner as in the stead of.]

   In the place or room of.

   Let thistles grow instead of wheat. Job 31.

     This consideration is instead of a thousand arguments. In this use,
                   instead may be equivalent to equal to.

     When instead is used without of following, there is an ellipsis, or
                         some words are understood.

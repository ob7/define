[1]calumet

   CALUMET, n. Among the aboriginals of America, a pipe, used for smoking
   tobacco, whose bowl is usually of soft red marble, and the tube a long
   reed, ornamented with feathers. The calumet is used as a symbol or
   instrument of peace and war. To accept the calumet, is to agree to the
   terms of peace, and to refuse it, is to reject them. The calumet of
   peace is used to seal or ratify contracts and alliances, to receive
   strangers kindly, and to travel with safety. The calumet of war,
   differently made, is used to proclaim war.

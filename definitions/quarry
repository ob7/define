    QUAR'RY, n. [I know not whether the original sense of this word was a
       pit or mine, from digging, or whether the sense was a place for
   squaring stone. L. curro. If the sense was a pit, it may be referred to
                                  the Heb.]

   1. A place, cavern or pit where stones are dug from the earth, or
   separated from a large mass of rocks. We generally apply the word mine
   to the pit from which are taken metals and coal; from quarries are
   taken stones for building, as marble, freestone, slate, &c.

   2. In Paris, the quarries are a vast cavern under the city, several
   miles in extent.

   QUAR'RY, v.i. To prey upon, as a vulture or harpy. [A low word and not
                                 much used.]

      QUAR'RY, v.t. To dig or take from a quarry; as, to quarry marble.

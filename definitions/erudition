   ERUDI'TION, n. Learning; knowledge gained by study, or from books and
   instruction; particularly, learning in literature, as distinct from the
   sciences, as in history, antiquity and languages. The Scaligers were
   men of deep erudition.

   The most useful erudition for republicans is that which exposes the
   causes of discords.

   investiture, made by the delivery of a turf, of a rod or twig, from the

   4. The state of being kept at a certain rate; as, to keep horses at
   livery.

   apostles, martyrs, penitents, &c. Hence,

   6. A particular dress or garb, appropriate or peculiar to particular
   times or things; as the livery of May; the livery of autumn.

   Now came still evening on, and twilight gray had in her sober livery
   all things clad.

   GRADE, n. [L. gradus, a step. gradior, to step to go, rota. We observe
   further that the Latin gradior forms gressus, by a common change of d
   to s; Heb. to descend.]

   1. A degree or rank in order or dignity, civil,military or
   ecclesiastical.

   While questions, periods, and grades and privileges are never once
   formally discussed.

   2. A step or degree in any ascending series; as crimes of every grade.

   When we come to examine the intermediate grades.

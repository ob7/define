   BO'VEY-COAL, n. Brown lignite, an inflammable fossil, resembling, in
   many of its properties, bituminous wood. Its structure is a little
   slaty; its cross fracture, even or conchoidal, with a resinous luster,
   somewhat shining. It is brittle, burns with a weak flame, and exhales
   an odor, which is generally disagreeable.

[1]mine

   MINE, a. called sometimes a pronominal adj. [L. meus.]

   My; belonging to me. It was formerly used before nouns beginning with
   vowels. "I kept myself from mine iniquity." Ps.18. But this use is no
   longer retained. We now use my before a vowel as well as before an
   articulation; as my iniquity. In present usage, my always precedes the
   noun, and mine follows the noun, and usually the verb; as, this is my
   book; this book is mine; it is called my book; the book is called mine:
   it is acknowledged to be mine.

   Mine sometimes supplies the place of a noun. Your sword and mine are
   different in construction.

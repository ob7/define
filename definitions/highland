   HIGHLAND, n. Elevated land; a mountainous region.

   Highlands of Scotland, mountainous regions inhabited by the descendants
   of the ancient Celts, who retain their primitive language.

   Highlands on the Hudson, sixty miles from New York. These afford most
   sublime and romantic scenery, and here is West Point, a fortified post
   during the revolution, and now the seat of one of the best military
   schools of the age.

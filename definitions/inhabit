   INHAB'IT, v.t. [L. inhabito; in and habito, to dwell.]

   To live or dwell in; to occupy as a place of settled residence. Wild
   beasts inhabit the forest; fishes inhabit the ocean, lakes and rivers;
   men inhabit cities and houses.

   Thus saith the high and lofty One, that inhabiteth eternity--Is.57.

                 INHAB'IT, v.i. To dwell; to live; to abide.

   They say wild beasts inhabit here.

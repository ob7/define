[1]dis

   DIS, a prefix or inseparable preposition, from the Latin, whence Fr.
   Des, Sp. Dis, and de may in some instances be the same word contracted.
   Dis denotes separation, a parting from; hence it has the force of a
   privative and negative, as in disarm, disoblige, disagree. In some
   cases, it still signifies separation, as in distribute, disconnect.

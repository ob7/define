   CONGRUITY, n.

   There is no congruity between a mean subject and a lofty style; but an
   obvious congruity between an elevated station and dignified deportment.

   2. Fitness, pertinence.

   A whole sentence may fail of its congruity by wanting a particle.

   3. Reason; consistency; propriety.

   4. In school divinity, the good actions which are supposed to render it
   meet and equitable that God should confer grace on those who perform
   them. The merit of congruity is a sort of imperfect qualification for
   the gift and reception of Gods grace.

   exactly correspond, are in congruity.

[1]ga

   GA, in Gothic, is a prefix, answering to ge in Saxon and other Teutonic
   languages. It sometimes has the force of the Latin cum or con, as in
   gawithan, to conjoin. But in most words it appears to have no use,and
   in modern English it is entirely lost. Y-cleped, in which ge is changed
   into y, is the last word in which the English retained this prefix.

   the company of those we love; we are sorry to lose friends or property;
   we are sorry for the misfortunes of our friends or of out country. And
   the king was sorry. Matt 14.

   2. Melancholy; dismal.

   3. Poor; mean; vile; worthless; as a sorry slave; a sorry excuse.
   Coarse complexions, and cheeks of sorry grain-

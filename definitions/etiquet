[1]etiquet

   ETIQUET', n. etiket'. [Eng. to dock. Originally, a little piece of
   paper, or a mark or title, affixed to a bag or bundle, expressing its
   contents.]

   Primarily, an account of ceremonies. Hence in present usage, forms of
   ceremony or decorum; the forms which are observed towards particular
   persons, or in particular places, especially in courts, levees, and on
   public occasions. From the original sense of the word, it may be
   inferred that it was formerly the custom to deliver cards containing
   orders for regulating ceremonies on public occasions.

   MO'CHA-STONE, n. Dendritic agate; a mineral in the interior of which
   appear brown, reddish brown, blackish or green delineations of shrubs
   destitute of leaves. These in some cases may have been produced by the
   filtration of the oxyds of iron and manganese; but in other cases they
   appear to be vegetable fibers, sometimes retaining their natural form
   and color, and sometimes coated by oxyd of iron.

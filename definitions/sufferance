   2. Toleration; permission; allowance; negative consent by not
   forbidding or hindering.

   In process of time, sometimes by sufferance, sometimes by special leave
   and favor, they erected to themselves oratories.

   But soon through sufferance grow to fearful end.

      possession of land by lawful title, but keeps it after the title
                ceases, without positive leave of the owner.

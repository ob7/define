   GIP'SEY, n. The Gipseys are a race of vagabonds which infest Europe,
   Africa and Asia, strolling about and subsisting mostly by theft,
   robbery and fortune-telling. The name is supposed to be corrupted from
   Egyptian, as they were thought to have come from Egypt. But their
   language indicates that they originated in Hindoostan.

   1. A reproachful name for a dark complexion.

   2. A name of slight reproach to a woman; sometimes implying artifice or
   cunning.

   A slave I am to Clara's eyes:

   The gipsey knows her power and flies.

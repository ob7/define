   EXEC'UTIVE, a. egzec'utive. Having the quality of executing or
   performing; as executive power or authority; an executive officer.
   Hence, in government, executive is used in distinction from legislative
   and judicial. The body that deliberates and enacts laws, is
   legislative; the body that judges, or applies the laws to particular
   cases, is judicial; the body or person who carries the laws into
   effect, or superintends the enforcement of them, is executive.

   It is of the nature of war to increase the executive, at the expense of
   the legislative authority.

     EXEC'UTIVE, n. The officer, whether king, president or other chief
   magistrate, who superintends the execution of the laws; the person who
   administers the government; executive power or authority in government.

   Men most desirous of places in the executive gift, will not expect to
   be gratified, except by their support of the executive.

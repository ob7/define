   DWARF, n.

   1. A general name for an animal or plant which is much below the
   ordinary size of the species or kind. A man that never grows beyond two
   or three feet in highth, is a dwarf. This word when used alone usually
   refers to the human species, but sometimes to other animals. When it is
   applied to plants, it is more generally used in composition; as a
   dwarf-tree; dwarf-elder.

   2. An attendant on a lady or knight in romances.

    DWARF, v.t. To hinder from growing to the natural size; to lessen; to
                             make or keep small.

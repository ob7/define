[1]infinite

   IN'FINITE, a. [L. infinitus; in and finitus, terminated.]

   1. Without limits; unbounded; boundless; not circumscribed; applied to
   time, space and qualities. God is infinite in duration, having neither
   beginning nor end of existence. He is also infinite in presence, or
   omnipresent, and his perfections are infinite. We also speak of
   infinite space.

   2. That will have no end. Thus angels and men, though they have had a
   beginning, will exist in infinite duration.

   3. That has a beginning in space, but is infinitely extended; as, a
   line beginning at a point, but extended indefinitely, is an infinite
   line.

   4. Infinite is used loosely and hyperbolically for indefinitely large,
   immense, of great size or extent.

                Infinite canon, in music, a perpetual fugue.

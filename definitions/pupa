[1]pupa

   PU'PA, n. [L. supra.] In natural history, an insect in that state in
   which it resembles an infant in swaddling clothes. As some insects in
   this state have a bright exterior,as if gilded, it has been called
   chrysalis or aurelia, from the Gr. and L. aurum, gold; but as this
   gilded appearance belongs to few insects, the term pupa is now more
   generally used.

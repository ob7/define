[1]sort

   SORT, n. [L. sors, lot, chance, state, way, sort. This word is form the
   root of L. sortior; the radical sense of which is to start or shoot, to
   throw or to fall, to come suddenly. Hence sore is lot, chance, that
   which comes or falls. This sense of sort is probably derivative,
   signifying that which is thrown out, separated or selected.]

   1. A kind or species; any number or collection of individual persons or
   thing characterized by the same or like qualities; as a sort of men; a
   sort of horses; a sort of trees; a sort of poems or writings. Sort is
   not a technical word, and therefore is used with less precision or more
   latitude than genus or species in the sciences.

   2. Manner; form of being or acting. Flowers, in such sort worn, can
   neither be smelt not seen well by those that wear them. To Adam in what
   sort shall I appear?

   3. Class or order; as men of the wiser sort, or the better sort; all
   sorts of people. [See Def. 1.]

   4. Rank; condition above the vulgar. [Not in use.]

   5. A company or knot of people. [Not in use.]

   6. Degree of any quality. I shall not be wholly without praise, if in
   some sort I have copied his style.

   7. Lot.

   8. A pair; a set; a suit.

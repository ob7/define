[1]m

   M is the thirteenth letter of the English Alphabet, and a labial
   articulation, formed by a compression of the lips. It is called a
   semi-vowel, as the articulation or compression of the lips is
   accompanied with a humming sound through the nose, which constitutes a
   difference between this letter and b. Its sound is uniform; as in man,
   time, rim.

   M is a numeral letter, and among the ancients stood for a thousand; a
   use which is retained by the moderns. With a dash or stroke over it, it
   stands for a thousand times a thousand, or a million.

   As an abbreviation, M stands for Marcus, Martius, Manlius or Mutius.

[1]intestine

   INTEST'INE, a. [L. intestinus, from intus, within.]

   1. Internal; inward; opposed to external; applied to the human or other
   animal body; as an intestine disease.

   2. Internal with regard to a state or country; domestic, not foreign;
   as intestine feuds; intestine war; intestine enemies. It is to be
   remarked that this word is usually or always applied to evils. We never
   say, intestine happiness or prosperity; intestine trade,manufactures or
   bills; but intestine broils, trouble, disorders, calamities, war, &c.
   We say, internal peace, welfare, prosperity, or internal broils,war,
   trade, &c. This restricted use of intestine seems to be entirely
   arbitrary.

   INTEST'INE, n. Usually in the plural, intestines. The bowels; the canal
   or tube that extends, with convolutions, from the right orifice of the
                            stomach to the anus.

   DISCRETIVE, a. [See Discreet and Discrete.]

   1. Disjunctive; noting separation or opposition. In logic, a discretive
   proposition expresses some distinction, opposition or variety, by means
   of but, though, yet, &c.; as, travelers change their climate, but not
   their temper; Job was patient, though his grief was great.

   2. In grammar, discretive distinctions are such as imply opposition or
   difference; as, not a man, but a beast.

   3. Separate; distinct.

   DREAM, n. [G.]

   1. The thought or series of thoughts of a person in sleep. We apply
   dream, in the singular, to a series of thoughts, which occupy the mind
   of a sleeping person, in which he imagines he has a view of real things
   or transactions. A dream is a series of thoughts not under the command
   of reason, and hence wild and irregular.

   2. In scripture, dreams were sometimes impressions on the minds of
   sleeping persons, made by divine agency. God came to Abimelech in a
   dream. Joseph was warned by God in a dream. Genesis 20. Matthew 2.

   3. A vain fancy; a wild conceit; an unfounded suspicion.

                  DREAM, v.i. pret. dreamed or dreamt. [G.]

   1. To have ideas or images in the mind, in the state of sleep; with of
   before a noun; as, to dream of a battle; to dream of an absent friend.

   2. To think; to imagine; as, he little dreamed of his approaching fate.

   3. To think idly.

   They dream on in a course of reading, without digesting.

   4. To be sluggish; to waste time in vain thoughts; as, to dream away
   life.

                       DREAM, v.t. To see in a dream.

   And dreamt the future fight.

   It is followed by a noun of the like signification; as, to dream a
   dream.

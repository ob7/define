   TEST'AMENT, n. [L. testamentum, from testor, to make a will.]

   1. A solemn authentic instrument in writing, by which a person declares
   his will as to the disposal of his estate and effects after his death.
   This is otherwise called a will. A testament,to be valid, must be made
   when the testator is of sound mind, and it must be subscribed,
   witnessed and published in such manner as the law prescribes.

   A man in certain cases may make a valid will by words only, and such
   will is called nuncupative.

   2. The name of each general division of the canonical books of the
   sacred Scriptures; as the Old Testament; the New Testament. The name is
   equivalent to covenant, and in our use of it, we apply it to the books
   which contain the old and new dispensations; that of Moses, and that of
   Jesus Christ.

[1]same

   SAME, a. [L. simul, together. Gr. Shall we suppose then that s has
   passed into an aspirate in this word, as in salt, Gr. or has the Greek
   word lost s? The word same may be the L. idem or dem, dialectically
   varied. The primary sense is to set, to place, to put together.]

   1. Identical; not different or other.

   Thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.

                                  Ps. 102.

   The Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread.
   1Cor. 11.

   2. Of the identical kind or species, though not the specific thing. We
   say, the horse of one country is the same animal as the horse of
   another country. The same plants and fruits are produced in the same
   latitudes. We see in men in all countries, the same passions and the
   same vices.

   Th' etherial vigor is in all the same.

   3. That was mentioned before.

   Do but think how well the same he spends, who spends his blood his
   country to relieve.

   4. Equal; exactly similar. One ship will not run the same distance as
   another in the same time, and with the same wind. Two balls of the same
   size have not always the same weight. Two instruments will not always
   make the same sound.

                          SAME, adv. Together. Obs.

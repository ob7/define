   1. Delivery; the act of delivering into the hands of another.

   A deed takes effect only from the tradition or delivery.

   The sale of a movable is completed by simple tradition.

   2. The delivery of opinions,doctrines, practices,rites and customs from
   father to son, or from ancestors to posterity; the transmission of any
   opinions or practice from forefathers to descendants by oral
   communication, without written memorials. Thus children derive their
   vernacular language chiefly from tradition. Most of our early notions
   are received by tradition from our parents.

   3. That which is handed down from age to age by oral communication. The
   Jews pay great regard to tradition in matters of religion, as do the

   things, and rely only on the written word. Traditions may be good or
   bad, true or false.

   Stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether
   by word or our epistle. 2 Thess. 2.

   Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your traditions?

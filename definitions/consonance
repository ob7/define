[1]consonance

   CONSONANCE, n. [L., to sound together; to sound. See Sound and Tone.]

   1. Accord or agreement of sounds. In music, consonance is an accord of
   sounds which produces an agreeable sensation in the ear, as the third,
   fifth and eighth. It denotes also the according intervals. When the
   interval of a consonance is invariable, it is called perfect; but when
   it may be either major or minor, it is termed imperfect.

   2. Agreement; accord; congruity; consistency; agreeableness;
   suitableness; as the consonance of opinions among judges; the
   consonance of a ritual to the scriptures.

   PON'GO, n. A name of the orang outang.

   The name pongo was applied by Buffon to a large species of orang
   outang, which is now ascertained to have been an imaginary animal. It
   is applied by Cuvier to the largest species of ape known, which
   inhabits Borneo, and resembles the true orang outang in its general
   form and erect position, but has the cheek pouches and lengthened
   muzzle of the baboon. It has also been applied [Ed.Encyc.] to the Simia
   troglodytes or chimpanzee of Curvier, a native of W. Africa.

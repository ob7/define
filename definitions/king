   KING, n.

   1. The chief or sovereign of a nation; a man invested with supreme
   authority over a nation, tribe or country; a monarch. Kings are
   absolute monarchs, when they possess the powers of government without
   control, or the entire sovereignty over a nation; they are limited
   monarchs, when their power is restrained by fixed laws; and they are
   absolute, when they possess the whole legislative, judicial, and
   executive power, or when the legislative or judicial powers, or both,
   are vested in other bodies of men. Kings are hereditary sovereigns,
   when they hold the powers of government by right of birth or
   inheritance, and elective, when raised to the throne by choice.

   Kings will be tyrants from policy, when subjects are rebels from
   principle.

   2. A sovereign; a prince; a ruler. Christ is called the king of his
   church. Ps.2

   3. A card having the picture of a king; as the king of diamonds.

   4. The chief piece in the game of chess.

   King at arms, an officer in England of great antiquity, and formerly of
    great authority, whose business is to direct the heralds, preside at
    their chapters, and have the jurisdiction of armory. There are three
       kings at arms, vix.garter, clarencieux, and norroy. The latter
                  [northroy] officiates north of the Trent.

     KING, v.t. In ludicrous language, to supply with a king, or to make
                         royal; to raise to royalty.

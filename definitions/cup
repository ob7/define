   1. A small vessel of capacity, used commonly to drink out of. It is
   usually made of metal; as a silver cup; a tin cup. But the name is also

   more deep than wide; but tea-cups and coffee-cups are often exceptions.

   contain; as a cup of beer. See 1 Corinthians 11.

   My cup runneth over. Psalm 23.

   Take the cup of salvation, that is, receive the blessings of
   deliverance and redemption with joy and thanksgiving.

   5. Any thing hollow like a cup; as the cup of an acorn. The bell of a
   flower, and a calyx is called a flower-cup.

   6. A glass cup or vessel used for drawing blood in scarification.

   Cup and can, familiar companions; the can being the large vessel out of
   which the cup is filled, and thus the two being constantly associated.

   Cups, in the plural, social entertainment in drinking; merry bout.

   Thence from cups to civil broils.

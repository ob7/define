[1]robust

   ROBUST', a. [L. robustus, from robur, strength.]

   1. Strong; lusty; sinewy; muscular; vigorous; forceful; as a robust
   body; robust youth. It implies full flesh and sound health.

   2. Sound; vigorous; as robust health.

   3. Violent; rough; rude.

   Romp loving miss is haul'd about in gallantry robust.

   4. Requiring strength; as robust employment.

   [Note. This is one of the words in which we observe a strong tendency
   in practice to accentuate the first syllable, as in access; and there
   are many situations of the word in which this is the preferable
   pronunciation. Robustious is extremely vulgar, and in the United States
   nearly obsolete.]

[1]acclamation

   ACCLAMA'TION, n. [L. acclamatio. See acclaim.]

   A shout of applause uttered by a multitude. Anciently, acclamation was
   a form of words, uttered with vehemence, somewhat resembling a song,
   sometimes accompanied with applauses which were given by the hands.
   Acclamations were ecclesiastical, military, nuptial, senatorial,
   synodical, theatrical, &e; They were musical and rythmical; and
   bestowed for joy, respect, and even reproach, and often accompanied
   with words, repeated, five, twenty, and even sixty and eighty times. In
   the later ages of Rome, acclamations were performed by a chorus of
   music instructed for the purpose.

   In modern times, acclamations are expressed by huzzas; by clapping of
   hands; and often by repeating vivat rex, vivat respublica, long live
   the king or republish, or other words expressive of joy and good
   wishes.

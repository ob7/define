   TROOP, n.

   1. A collection of people; a company; a number; a multitude. Gen.49. 2
   Sam.23. Hos.7.

   That which should accompany old age,

   As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,

   I must not look to have.

   2. A body of soldiers. But applied to infantry, it is now used in the
   plural, troops, and this word signifies soldiers in general, whether
   more or less numerous, including infantry, cavalry and artillery. We
   apply the word to a company, a regiment or an army. The captain ordered
   his troops to halt; the colonel commanded his troops to wheel and take
   a position on the flank; the general ordered his troops to attack; the
   troops of France amounted to 400,000 men.

   3. Troop, in the singular, a small body or company of cavalry, light
   horse or dragoons, commanded by a captain.

   4. A company of stage-players.

   I do not, as an enemy to peace,

   Troop in the throngs of military men.

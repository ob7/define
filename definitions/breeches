[1]breeches

   BREECHES, n. plu. brich'es. [Low L. braccoe.]

   A garment worn by men, covering the hips and thighs. It is now a close
   garment; but the word formerly was used for a loose garment, now called
   trowsers, laxoe braccoe.

   To wear the breeches is, in the wife, to usurp the authority of the
   husband.

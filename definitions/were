[1]were

   WERE, pron. er, which when prolonged, becomes ware. This is used as the
   imperfect tense plural of be; we were, you were, they were; and in some
   other tenses. It is the Danish verb vaerer, to be, to exist, and in
   origin has no connection with be, nor with was. It is united with be,
   to supply its want of tenses, as went is with go.

   WERE, n. A dam. [See Wear.]

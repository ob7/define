   MONKEY, n. The popular name of the ape and baboon. But in zoology,
   monkey is more properly the name of those animals of the genus Simia,
   which have long tails. Ray distributes animals of this kind into three
   classes; apes which have no tails; monkeys with long tails; and baboons
   with short tails.

   1. A name of contempt or of slight kindness.

[1]as

   AS, adv. az. [Gr. But more probably the English word is contracted from
   als.]

   1. Literally, like; even; similar. "Ye shall be as Gods, knowing good
   and evil." "As far as we can see," that is, like far, equally far.
   Hence it may be explained by in like manner; as, do as you are
   commanded.

   2. It was formerly used where we now use that. Obs.

   The relations are so uncertain as they require a great deal of
   examination.

   3. It was formerly used where we now use that. Obs.

   He lies, as he his bliss did know.

   4. While; during; at the same time. "He trembled as he spoke." But in
   most of its uses, it is resolvable into like, equal, even, or equally,
   in like manner. In some phrases, it must be considered a nominative
   word, or other words must be supplied. "Appoint to office such men as
   deserve public confidence." This phrase may be elliptical for "such men
   as those who deserve public confidence."

   As seems, in some cases, to imply the sense of proportion. "In general,
   men are more happy, as they are less involved in public concerns."

   As, in a subsequent part of a sentence, answers to such; give us such
   things as you please; and in a preceding part of a sentence, has so to
   answer to it; as with the people, so with the priest.

                                 AS, n. [L.]

   1. A Roman weight of 12 ounces, answering to the libra or pound.

   2. A Roman coin, originally of a pound weight; but reduced, after the
   first Punic war, to two ounces; in the second Punic war, to one ounce;
   and by the Papirian law, to half an ounce. It was originally stamped
   with the figure of a sheep, sow, or ox; and afterwards with a Janus, on
   one side, and on the reverse, a rostrum or prow of a ship.

   3. An integer; a whole or single thing. Hence the English ace. Hence
   the Romans used the word for the whole inheritance; haeres ex asse, an
   heir to the whole estate.

[1]angelites

   AN'GELITES, in Church history, so called from Angelicum in Alexandria,
   where they held their first meetings, a sect of heretics near the close
   of the 5th century, who held the persons of the trinity not to be the
   same, nor to exist by their own nature; but each to be a God existing
   by participating of a deity common to them all. They are called also
   Severites, from Severus, their head; and Theodosians, from one
   Theodosius, whom they made their Pope.

[1]roam

   ROAM, v.i. [If m is radical, this word seems to be connected with
   ramble, L. ramus.]

   To wander; to ramble; to rove; to walk or move about from place to
   place without any certain purpose or direction. The wolf and the savage
   roam in the forest.

   Daphne roaming through a thorny wood.

     ROAM, v.t. To range; to wander over; as, to roam the woods; but the
                            phrase is elliptical.

[1]wages

   WAGES, n. plural in termination, but singular in signification.

   1. Hire; reward; that which is paid or stipulated for services; but
   chiefly for services by manual labor, or for military and naval
   services. We speak of servants wages, a laborers wages, or soldiers
   wages; but we never apply the word to the rewards given to men in
   office, which are called fees or salary. The word is however sometimes
   applied to the compensation given to representatives in the
   legislature. [U. States]

   Tell me, what shall thy wages be? Gen. 29.

   Be content with your wages. Luke 3.

   2. Reward; fruit; recompense; that which is given or received in
   return.

   The wages of sin is death. Rom. 6.

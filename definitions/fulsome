[1]fulsome

   FUL'SOME, a.

   1. Nauseous; offensive.

   He that brings fulsome objects to my view, with nauseous images my
   fancy fills.

   2. Rank; offensive to the smell; as a rank and fulsome smell.

   3. Lustful; as fulsome ewes.

   4. Tending to obscenity; as a fulsome epigram.

   These are the English definitions of fulsome, but I have never
   witnessed such applications of the word in the United States. It seems
   then that full and foul are radically the same word, the primary sense
   of which is stuffed, crowded, from the sense of putting on or in. In
   the United States, the compound fullsome takes its signification from
   full, in the sense of cloying or satiating, and in England, fulsome
   takes its predominant sense from foulness.

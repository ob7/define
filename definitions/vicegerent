   VICEGE'RENT, n. [L. vicem gereus, acting in the place of another.]

   A lieutenant; a vicar; an officer who is deputed by a superior or by
   proper authority to exercise the powers of another. Kings are sometimes
   called God's vicegerents. It is to be wished they would always deserve
   the appellation.

       VICEGE'RENT, a. Having or exercising delegated power; acting by
                  substitution, or in the place of another.

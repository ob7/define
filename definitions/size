[1]size

   SIZE, n. [either contracted from assize, or from the L. scissus. I take
   it to be from the former, and from the sense of setting, as we apply
   the word to the assize of bread.]

   1. Bulk; bigness; magnitude; extent of superficies. Size particularly
   expresses thickness; as the size of a tree or of a mast; the size of a
   ship or of a rock. A man may be tall, with little size of body.

   2. A settled quantity of allowance. [contracted from assize.]

   3. Figurative bulk; condition as to rank and character; as men of less
   size and quality. [Not much used.]

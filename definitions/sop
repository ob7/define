[1]sop

   SOP, n.

   1. Anything steeped or dipped and softened in liquor, but chiefly
   something thus dipped in broth or liquid food, and intended to be
   eaten. Sops in win, quantity for quantity, inebriate more than win
   itself.

   2. Any thing given to pacify; so called from the sop given to Cerberus,
   in mythology. Hence the phrase, to give a sop to Cerberus.

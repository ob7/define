   COMPANION, n.

   1. One who keeps company with another; one with whom a person
   frequently associates, and converses. It differs from friend, says
   Johnson, as acquaintance from confidence. The word does not necessarily
   imply friendship; but a companion is often or generally a friend.

   A companion of fools shall be destroyed. Prov. 13.

   2. One who accompanies another; as two persons meeting casually and
   traveling together are called companions. So soldiers are called
   companions in arms.

   3. A partner; an associate.

   Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labor, and fellow soldier.
   Phil. 2.

   4. A fellow; a mate.

   5. A sort of wooden porch placed over the entrance or stair case of the
   cabin in merchant ships. Hence the ladder by which officers ascend to
   and descend from the quarter deck is called the companion ladder.

   EMBLA'ZE, v.t.

   1. To adorn with glittering embellishments.

   No weeping orphan saw his father's stores

   Our shrines irradiate, or emblaze the floors.

   2. To blazon; to paint or adorn with figures armorial.

   The imperial ensign, streaming to the wind,

   With gems and golden luster rich emblazed.

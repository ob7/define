[1]prudence

   PRU'DENCE, n. [L. prudentia.] Wisdom applied to practice.

   Prudence implies caution in deliberating and consulting on the most
   suitable means to accomplish valuable purposes, and the exercise of
   sagacity in discerning and selecting them. Prudence differs from wisdom
   in this, that prudence implies more caution and reserve than wisdom, or
   is exercised more in foreseeing and avoiding evil, than in devising and
   executing that which is good. It is sometimes mere caution or
   circumspection.

   Prudence is principally in reference to actions to be done, and due
   means, order, season and method of doing or not doing.

   WINTER, n.

   1. The cold season of the year. Astronomically considered, winter
   commences in northern latitudes when the sun enters Capricorn, or at
   the solstice about the 21st of December, and ends at the equinox in
   March; but in ordinary discourse, the three winter months are December,
   January, and February. Our Saxon ancestors reckoned the years by
   winters; as ten winters; thirty winters. In tropical climates, there
   are two winters annually; but they cannot be said to be cold. In the
   temperate and frigid climates, there is one winter only in the year.

   2. The part of the printing press which sustains the carriage.

    WINTER, v.i. To pass the winter. He wintered in Italy. Cattle winter
                            well on good fodder.

      WINTER, v.t. To feed or manage during the winter. To winter young
    cattle on straw, is not profitable. Delicate plants must be wintered
                                under cover.

   THUN'DER, n. [L. tonitru, from tono, to sound.]

   1. The sound which follows an explosion of electricity or lightning;
   the report of a discharge of electrical fluid, that is, of its passage
   from one cloud to another, or from a cloud to the earth, or from the
   earth to a cloud. When this explosion is near to a person, the thunder
   is a rattling or clattering sound, and when distant, the sound is heavy
   and rumbling. The fact is in some degree the same with the report of a
   cannon. This sharpness or acuteness of the sound when near, and the
   rumbling murmur when distant, are the principal distinctions in
   thunder. [Thunder is not lightning, but the effect of it. See Johnson's
   dictionary_webster1828, under thunder.]

   There were thunders and lightnings. Ex.19.

   2. Thunder is used for lightning, or for a thunderbolt, either
   originally through ignorance, or by way of metaphor, or because the
   lightning and thunder are closely united.

[1]mystery

   MYS'TERY, n. [L. mysterium; Gr. a secret. This word in Greek is
   rendered also murium latibulum; but probably both senses are from that
   of hiding or shutting; Gr. to shut, to conceal.

   1. A profound secret; something wholly unknown or something kept
   cautiously concealed, and therefore exciting curiosity or wonder; such
   as the mystery of the man with the iron mask in France.

   2. In religion, any thing in the character or attributes of

    God, or in the economy of divine providence, which is not revealed to
                                    man.

   3. That which is beyond human comprehension until explained. In this
   sense, mystery often conveys the idea of something awfully sublime or
   important; something that excites wonder.

   Great is the mystery of godliness. 1 Tim.3.

   Having made known to us the mystery of his will. Eph.1.

   We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery. 1 Cor.2.

   4. An enigma; any thing artfully made difficult.

   5. A kind of ancient dramatic representation.

   6. A trade; a calling; any mechanical occupation which supposes skill
   or knowledge peculiar to those who carry it on, and therefore a secret
   to others.

     [The word in the latter sense has been supposed to have a different
                      origin from the foregoing, viz.]

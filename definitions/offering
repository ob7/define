[1]offering

   OF'FERING, ppr. Presenting; proposing; sacrificing; bidding; presenting
   to the eye or mind.

   OF'FERING, n. That which is presented in divine service; an animal or a
   portion of bread or corn, or of gold and silver, or other valuable
   articles, presented to God as an atonement for sin, or as a return of
   thanks for his favors, or for other religious purpose; a sacrifice; an
   oblation. In the Mosaic economy, there were burnt-offerings,
   sin-offerings, peace-offerings, trespass-offerings, thank-offerings,
   wave-offerings, and wood-offerings. Pagan nations also present
   offerings to their deities. Christ by the offering of himself has
   superseded the use of all other offerings, having made atonement for
   all men.

   When thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his
   seed - Is. 53.

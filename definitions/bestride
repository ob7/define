   BESTRI'DE, v.t. pret.bestrid; pp. bestrid, bestridden. [be and stride.]

   1. To stride over; to stand or sit with any thing between the legs, or
   with the legs extended across; as, to bestride the world, like a
   colossus; to bestride a horse.

   2. To step over; as, to bestride a threshold.

   Bestriding sometimes includes riding, or defending, as Johnson remarks;
         but the particular purposes to the act, which depend on the
       circumstances of the case, can hardly be reduced to definition.

   TEAR, n.

   1. Tears are the limpid fluid secreted by the lacrymal gland, and
   appearing in the eyes, or flowing from them. A tear, in the singular,
   is a drop or a small quantity of that fluid. Tears are excited by
   passions, particularly by grief. This fluid is also called forth by any
   injury done to the eye. It serves to moisten the cornea and preserve
   its transparency, and to remove any dust or fine substance that enters
   the eye and gives pain.

   2. Something in the form of a transparent drop of fluid matter.

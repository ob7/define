   part of the increase annually arising from the profits of land and
   stock, allotted to the clergy for their support. Tithes are personal,
   predial, or mixed; personal, when accruing from labor, art, trade and
   navigation; predial, when issuing from the earth, as hay, wood and
   fruit; and mixed, when accruing from beasts, which are fed from the
   ground.

   TITHE, v.t. To levy a tenth part on; to tax to the amount of a tenth.

   When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine increase.
   Deut. 26.

   Ye tithe mint and rue. Luke 11.

                         TITHE, v.i. To pay tithes.

[1]metropolis

   METROP'OLIS, n. [L. from Gr. mother, and city. It has no plural.]

   Literally, the mother-city, that is, the chief city or capital of a
   kingdom, state or country, as Paris in France, Madrid in Spain, London
   in Great Britain. In the United States, Washington, in the District of
   Columbia, is the metropolis, as being the seat of government; but in
   several of the states, the largest cities are not the seats of the
   respective governments. Yet New York city, in the state of that name,
   and Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, are the chief cities, and may be
   called each the metropolis of the state in which it is situated, though
   neither of them is the seat of government in the state.

   ASTRE'A, n. [Gr. a star.]

   The goddess of justice. A name sometimes given to the sign virgo. The
   poets feign that justice quitted heaen, in the golden age, to reside on
   earth; but becoming weary with the iniquities of men, she return to
   heaven, and commenced a constellation of stars.

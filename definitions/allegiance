[1]allegiance

   ALLE'GIANCE, n. [L. alligo, of ad and ligo, to bind. See Liege and
   League.]

   The tie or obligation of a subject to his Prince or government; the
   duty of fidelity to a king, government or state. Every native or
   citizen owes allegiance to the government under which he is born. This
   is called natural or implied allegiance, which arises from the
   connection of a person with the society in which he is born, and his
   duty to be a faithful subject, independent of any express promise.
   Express allegiance, is that obligation which proceeds from an express
   promise, or oath of fidelity.

   Local or temporary allegiance is due from an alien to the government or
   state in which he resides.

[1]what

   WHAT, pronoun relative or substitute. [G., L. See Wight.]

   1. That which. Say what you will, is the same as say that which you
   will.

   2. Which part. Consider what is due to nature, and what to art or
   labor.

   3. What is the substitute for a sentence or clause of a sentence. I
   tell thee what, corporal, I could tear her. Here what relates to the
   last clause, I could tear her; this is what I tell you.

   4. What is used as an adjective, of both genders, often in specifying
   sorts or particulars. See what colors this silk exhibits. I know what
   qualities you desire in a friend; that is, I know the qualities which
   you desire.

   5. What is much used in asking questions. What sort of character is
   this? What poem is this? What man is this we see coming?

   6. What time, at the time or on the day when.

   What time the morn mysterious visions brings.

   7. To how great a degree.

   What a partial judges are our love and hate!

   8. Whatever.

   Whether it was the shortness of his foresight, the strength of his
   will--or what it was--

   9. Some part, or some. The year before, he had so used the matter, that
   what by force, what by policy, he had taken from the Christians above
   thirty castles; that is, he had taken above thirty castles; that is, he
   had taken above thirty castles, a part or some by force, a part or some
   by policy; or what may be interpreted partly. Sometimes what has no
   verb to govern it, and it must be considered as adverbially used. What
   with carrying apples and fuel, he finds himself in a hurry; that is,
   partly, in part.

   10. What is sometimes used elliptically for what is this, or how is
   this?

   What! Could ye not watch with me one hour? Matthew 26.

   11. What is used interrogatively and elliptically, as equivalent to
   what will be the consequence? What will follow? As in the phrase, what
   if I undertake this business myself?

   What though, that is, grant this or that; allow it to be so.

   What ho, an exclamation of calling.

                WHAT, n. Fare; things; matter. [Not in use.]

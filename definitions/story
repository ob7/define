   STORY, n. [L., Gr.]

   1. A verbal narration or recital of a series of facts or incidents. WE
   observe in children a strong passion for hearing stories.

   2. A written narrative of a series of facts or events. There is
   probably on record no story more interesting than that of Joseph in
   Genesis.

   3. History; a written narrative or account of past transactions,
   whether relating to nations or individuals.

   The four great monarchies make the subject of ancient story.

   4. Petty tale; relation of a single incident or of trifling incidents.

   5. A trifling tale; a fiction; a fable; as the story of a fairy. In
   popular usage, story is sometimes a softer term for a lie.

   6. A loft; a floor; or a set of rooms on the same floor or level. A
   story comprehends the distance from one floor to another; as a story of
   nine or ten feet elevation. Hence each floor terminating the space is
   called a story; as a house of one story, of two stories, of five
   stories. The farm houses in New England have usually two stories; the
   houses in Paris have usually five stories; a few have more; those in
   London four. But in the United States the floor next the ground is the
   first story; in France and England, the first floor or story, is the
   second from the ground.

                                 STORY, v.t.

   1. To tell in historical relation; to narrate.

   How worthy he is, I will leave to appear hereafter, rather than story
   him in his own hearing.

   It is storied of the brazen colossus in Rhodes, that it was seventy
   cubits high.

   [This verb is chiefly used in the passive participle.]

   2. To range one under another. [Little used.]

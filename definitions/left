   LEFT, pret. and pp. of leave.

   LEFT, a. [L. lavus; Gr. probably from the root of leave, Gr. and
   properly weak, deficient. Applied to the hand or arm, it denotes the
   weak arm, as opposed to the right, the strong or dextrous. Hence the
   ancient idea of sinister, unfortunate, attached to the left arm or
   side.]

   1. Denoting the part opposed to the right of the body; as the left
   hand, arm or side. Hence, the noun being omitted, we say, on the left,
   that is, on the left side or wing, as of an army.

   2. The left bank of a river, is that which is on the left hand of a
   person whose face is towards the mouth of the river.

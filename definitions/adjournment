[1]adjournment

   ADJOURN'MENT, n.

   1. The act of adjourning; as, in legislatures, the adjournment of one
   house is not an adjournment of the other.

   2. The putting off till another day or time specified, or without day;
   that is, the closing of a session of a public or official body.

   3. The time or interval during which a public body defers business; as,
   during an adjournment. but a suspension of business, between the
   forming of a house and an adjournment for refreshment, is all a recess.
   In Great Britain, the close of a session of parliament is called a
   prorogation; as the close of a parliament is a dissolution. But in
   Great Britain, as well as in the United States, adjournment is now used
   for an intermission of business, for any indefinite time; as, an
   adjournment of parliament for six weeks.

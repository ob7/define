[1]apatite

   AP'ATITE, n. [From Gr. to deceive; it having been often mistaken for
   other minerals.]

   A variety of phosphate of lime; generally crystallized in low, flat,
   hexahedral prisms, sometimes even tabular. Its powder phosphoresces on
   burning coals.

   The phosporite of Werner includes the massive and earthy varieties of
   the phosphate, which are distinguished from the apatite, by their
   containing a small portion of fluoric acid.

[1]un

   UN, a prefix or inseparable preposition, un or on, usually un, an, is
   the same word as the L. in. It is a particle of negation, giving to
   words to which it is prefixed, a negative signification. We use un or
   in indifferently for this purpose; and the tendency of modern usage is
   to prefer the use of in, in some words, where un was formerly used. Un
   admits of no change of n into l, m or r, as in does, in illuminate,
   immense, irresolute. It is prefixed generally to adjectives and
   participles, and almost at pleasure. In a few instances, it is prefixed
   to verbs, as in unbend, unbind, unharness. As the compounds formed with
   un are so common and so well known, the composition is not noticed
   under the several words. For the etymologies, see the simple words.

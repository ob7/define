[1]likely

   LI'KELY, a. [that is, like-like.]

   1. Probable; that may be rationally though or believed to have taken
   place in time past, or to be true now or hereafter; such as is more
   reasonable than the contrary. A likely story, is one which evidence, or
   the circumstances of the case render probable, and therefore credible.

   2. Such as may be liked; pleasing; as a likely man or woman.

   [This use of likely is not obsolete, as Johnson affirms, nor is it
   vulgar. But the English and their descendants in America differ in the
   application. The English apply the word to external appearance, and
   with them, likely is equivalent to handsome, well formed; as a likely
   man, a likely horse. In America, the word is usually applied to the
   endowments of the mind, or to pleasing accomplishments. With us, a
   likely man, is a man of good character and talents, or of good
   dispositions or accomplishments, that render him pleasing or
   respectable.]

                           LI'KELY, adv. Probably.

   While man was innocent, he was likely ignorant of nothing important for
   him to know.

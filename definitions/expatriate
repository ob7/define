[1]expatriate

   EXPAT'RIATE, v.t. [L. ex and patria, country.]

   In a general sense, to banish.

   To expatriate one's self, is to quit one's country, renouncing
   citizenship and allegiance in that country, to take residence and
   become a citizen in another country. The right to expatriate one's self
   is denied in feudal countries, and much controverted in the U. States.

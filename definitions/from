[1]from

   FROM, prep.

   The sense of from may be expressed by the noun distance, or by the
   adjective distant, or by the participles, departing, removing to a
   distance. Thus it is one hundred miles from Boston to Hartford. He took
   his sword from his side. Light proceeds from the sun. Water issues from
   the earth in springs. Separate the coarse wool from the fine. Men have
   all sprung from Adam. Men often go from good to bad, and from bad to
   worse. The merit of an action depends on the principle from which it
   proceeds. Men judge of facts from personal knowledge, or from
   testimony. We should aim to judge from undeniable premises.

   The sense of from is literal or figurative, but it is uniformly the
   same.

   In certain phrases, generally or always elliptical, from is followed by
   certain adverbs, denoting place, region or position, indefinitely, no
   precise point being expressed; as,

   From above, from the upper regions.

   From afar, from a distance.

   From beneath, from a place or region below.

   From below, from a lower place.

   From behind, from a place or position in the rear.

   From far, from a distant place.

   From high, from on high, from a high place, from an upper region, or
   from heaven.

   From hence, from this place; but from is superfluous before hence. The
   phrase however is common.

   From thence, from that place; from being superfluous.

   From whence, from which place; from being superfluous.

   From where, from which place.

   From within, from the interior or inside.

                From without, from the outside, from abroad.

   From precedes another preposition, followed by its proper object or
   case.

   From amidst, as from amidst the waves.

   From among, as from among the trees.

   From beneath, as from beneath my head.

   From beyond, as from beyond the river.

   From forth, as from forth his bridal bower. But this is an inverted
   order of the words; forth from his bower.

   From off, as from off the mercy seat, that is, from the top or surface.

   From out, as from out a window, that is, through an opening or from the
   inside.

   From out of, is an ill combination of words and not to be used.

   From under, as from under the bed, from under the ashes, that is, from
   beneath or the lower side.

   From within, as from within the house, that is, from the inner part or
   interior.

[1]depopulate

   DEPOPULATE, v.t. [L. To ravage or lay waste.] To dispeople; to
   unpeople; to deprive of inhabitants, whether by death, or by expulsion.
   It is not synonymous with laying waste or destroying, being limited to
   the loss of inhabitants; as, an army or a famine may depopulate a
   country. It rarely expresses an entire loss of inhabitants, but often a
   great diminution of their numbers. The deluge nearly depopulated the
   earth.

   DEPOPULATE, v.i. To become dispeopled.

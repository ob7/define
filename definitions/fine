   labors of the mind or imagination, and whose object is pleasure; as

    FINE, n. [This word is the basis of finance, but I have not found it,
     in its simple form, in any modern language, except the English. The
    word seems to be the L. finis, and the application of it to pecuniary
      compensation seems to have proceeded from its feudal use, in the
      transfer of lands, in which a final agreement or concord was made
                      between the lord and his vassal.]

   1. In a feudal sense, a final agreement between persons concerning
   lands or rents, or between the lord and his vassal, prescribing the
   conditions on which the latter should hold his lands.

   2. A sum of money paid to the lord by his tenant, for permission to
   alienate or transfer his lands to another. This in England was exacted
   only from the king's tenants in capite.

   3. A sum of money paid to the king or state by way of penalty for an
   offense; a mulet; a pecuniary punishment. Fines are usually prescribed
   by statute, for the several violations of law; or the limit is
   prescribed, beyond which the judge cannot impose a fine for a
   particular offense.

   In fine. [L. in and finis.] In the end or conclusion; to conclude; to
   sum up all.

                    FINE, v.t. [See Fine, the adjective.]

   1. To clarify; to refine; to purify; to defecate; to free from
   feculence or foreign matter; as, to fine wine.

   [This is the most general use of this word.]

   2. To purify, as a metal; as, to fine gold or silver. In this sense, we
   now generally use refine; but fine is proper.

                              Job 28. Prov. 17.

   3. To make less coarse; as, to fine grass. [Not used.]

   month.

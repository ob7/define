   WALE-KNOT, WALL-KNOT, n. A single wale-knot is made by untwisting the
   ends of a rope, and making a bight with the first strand; then passing
   the second over the end of the first, and the third over the end of the
   second, and through the bight of the first. The double is made by
   passing the ends, singly, close underneath the first wale, and
   thrusting them upwards through the middle, only the last end comes up
   under two bights.

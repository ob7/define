[1]behoove

   BEHOOVE, v.t. behoof'. To be necessary for; to be fit for; to be meet
   for, with respect to necessity, duty, or convenience.

   And thus it behooved Christ to suffer. Luke 24.

   It may perhaps be used intransitively; as, let him behave as it
   behooveth; but I believe such use is rare.

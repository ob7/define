[1]nisiprius

   NISIPRIUS, n. In law, a writ which lies in cases where the jury being
   impaneled and returned before the justices of the bench, one of the
   parties requests to have this writ for the ease of the country, that
   the cause may be tried before the justices of the same county. The
   purport of the writ is, that the sheriff is commanded to bring to
   Westminster the men impanneled at a certain day, before the justices,
   nisi prius, that is, unless the justices shall first come into the
   county to take assizes. Hence the courts directed to try matters of
   fact in the several counties are called courts of Nisi Prius, or Nisi
   Prius courts. In some of the United States, similar courts are
   established, with powers defined by statute.

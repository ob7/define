   CHARD n. The leaves of artichokes tied and wrapped all over, except the
   top, in straw, during autumn and winter. This makes them grow white and
   lose some of their bitterness.

   Chards of beet are plants of white beet transplanted, producing great
   tops, which, in the midst, have a large, white, thick, downy,
   cotton-like main shoot, which is the true chard.

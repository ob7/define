[1]o

   O is the fifteenth letter, and the fourth vowel in the English
   Alphabet. The shape of this letter seems to have been taken from the
   circular configuration of the lips in uttering the sound. It
   corresponds in figure with the Coptic O, and nearly with the Syriac
   initial and final vau, and the Ethiopic ain. In words derived from the
   oriental languages, it often represents the vau of those languages, and
   sometimes the ain; the original sound of the latter being formed deep
   in the throat, and with a greater aperture of the mouth.

   In English, O has a long sound, as in tone, hone, groan, cloke, roll,
   droll; a short sound, as in lot plod, rod, song, lodge. The sound of oo
   is shortened in words ending in a close articulation, as in book and
   foot.

   The long sound of O, is usually denoted by e, at the end of a word or
   syllable, as in bone, lonely; or by a servile a, as in moan, foal. It
   is generally long before ll, as in roll; but it is short in doll, loll,
   and in words of more syllables than one, as in folly, volley.

   As a numeral, O was sometimes used by the ancients for 11, and with a
   dash over it for 11,000.

   Among the ancients, O was a mark of tripe time, from the notion that
   the ternary or number 3, is the most perfect of numbers, and properly
   expressed by a circle, the most perfect figure.

   O is often used as an exclamation, expressing a wish.

   O, were he present.

   It sometimes expresses surprise. Shakespeare uses O for a circle or
   oval.

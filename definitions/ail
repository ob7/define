[1]ail

   AIL, v.t.

   To trouble; to affect with uneasiness, either of body or mind; used to
   express some uneasiness or affection, whose cause is unknown; as, what
   ails the man? I know not what ails him.

   What aileth thee, Hagar? Gen. 21.

   It is never used to express a specific disease. We never say, he ails a
   pleurisy; but it is unusual to say, he ails something; he ails nothing;
   nothing ails him.

                 AIL, n. Indisposition, or morbid affection.

   CHANCE-MEDLEY, n. In law, the killing of a person by chance, when the
   killer is doing a lawful act; for if he is doing an unlawful act, it is
   felony. As if a man, when throwing bricks from a house into a street
   where people are continually passing, after giving warning to
   passengers to take care, should kill a person, this is chance-medley.
   But if he gives no warning, and kills a man, it is manslaughter.

   IMMEMO'RIAL, a. [L. in and memor, memoria.]

   Beyond memory; an epithet given to time or duration, &c., whose
   beginning is not remembered, or cannot be traced and ascertained; as
   when it is said a man has possessed an estate in fee from time
   immemorial, or time out of mind. Such possession constitutes
   prescription, or prescriptive right. So we speak of immemorial use,
   custom or practice. In England, a thing is said to be immemorial, when
   it commenced before the reign of Edward II.

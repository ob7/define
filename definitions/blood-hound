   BLOOD-HOUND, n. [blood and hound.] A species of canis or dog, with
   long, smooth and pendulous ears, remarkable for the acuteness of its
   smell, and employed to recover game which had escaped wounded from the
   hunter, by tracing the lost animal by the blood it had spilt; whence
   the name of the dog.

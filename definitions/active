   ACT'IVE, a. [L. activus.]

   1. That has the power or quality of acting; that contains the principle
   of action, independent of any visible external force; as, attraction is
   an active power: or it may be defined, that communicates action or
   motion, opposed to passive, that receives action; as, the active powers
   of the mind.

   2. Having the power of quick motion, or disposition to move with speed;
   nimble; lively; brisk; agile; as an active animal.

                                   Hence,

   3. Busy; constantly engaged in action; pursuing business with vigor and
   assiduity; opposed to dull, slow, or indolent; as an active officer. It
   is also opposed to sedentary, as an active life.

   4. Requiring action or exertion; practical; operative; producing real
   effects; opposed to speculative; as, the active duties of life.

   5. In grammar, active verbs are those which not only signify action,
   but have a noun or name following them, denoting the object of the
   action or impression; called also transitive, as they imply the passing
   of the action expressed by the verb to the object; as a professor
   instructs his pupils.

   6. Active capital, or wealth, is money, or property that may readily be
   converted into money, and used in commerce or other employment for
   profit.

   7. Active commerce, the commerce in which a nation carries its own
   productions and foreign commodities in its own ships, or which is
   prosecuted by its own citizens; as contradistinguished from passive
   commerce, in which the productions of one country are transported by
   the people of another country.

   The commerce of Great Britain and of the United States is active; that
   of China is passive.

   It may be the interest of foreign nations to deprive us, as far as
   possible, of an active commerce in our own bottoms.

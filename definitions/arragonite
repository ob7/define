   AR'RAGONITE, n.

   In mineralogy, a species of carbonate of lime, but not pure, and said
   to contain 3 or 4 per cent. of carbonate of strontian. It differs from
   pure carbonate of lime, in hardness, specific gravity, crystaline
   structure, &c. It is harder than calcarious spar, and exhibits several
   varieties of structure and form. It is often crystallized, generally in
   hexahedral prisms or pyramids. The massive varieties have usually a
   fibrous structure, exhibiting various imitative forms, being sometimes
   coraloidal.

[1]bastion

   BAS'TION, n. bas'chun. A huge mass of earth, usually faced with

   56

   sods, sometimes with brick, or stones, standing out from a rampart, of
    which it is a principal part; formerly called a bulwark. Bastions are
    solid or hollow. A flat bastion is made in the middle of the curtain,
    when it is too long to be defended by the bastions in its extremes. A
      cut bastion has its point cut off and instead of it a re-entering
   angle, or an angle inwards, with two points outward. A composed bastion
    has two sides of the interior polygon unequal, which makes the gorges
    unequal. A demibastion is composed of one face only, which makes the
    gorges unequal. A demibastion is composed of one face only, with one
    flank and a demigorge. A double bastion is one raised on the plane of
                                  another.

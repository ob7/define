   master.]

   1. To unite in wedlock or matrimony; to join a man and woman for life,
   and constitute them man and wife according to the laws or customs of a
   nation. By the laws, ordained clergymen have a right to marry persons
   within certain limits prescribed.

   Tell him he shall marry the couple himself.

   2. To dispose of in wedlock.

   Mecaenas told Augustus he must either marry his daughter Julia to
   Agrippa, or take away his life.

   [In this sense, it is properly applicable to females only.]

   3. To take for husband or wife. We say, a man marries a woman; or a
   woman marries a man. The first was the original sense,but both are now
   well authorized.

   4. In Scripture, to unite in covenant, or in the closest connection.

   Turn, O backsliding children, saith Jehovah, for I am married to you.
   Jer.3.

   MAR'RY, v.i. To enter into the conjugal state; to unite as husband and
                     wife; to take a husband or a wife.

   If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.
   Matt.19.

   I will therefore that the younger women marry. 1 Tim.5.

    MAR'RY, a term of asseveration, is said to have been derived from the
          practice of swearing by the virgin Mary. It is obsolete.

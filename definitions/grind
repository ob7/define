   GRIND, v.t. pret. and pp. ground. [This word, if n is radical, may be
   allied to rend; if not, it coincides with grate; to make smooth, as
   mollis in L., allied to molo.]

   1. To break and reduce to fine particles or powder by friction; to
   comminute by attrition; to triturate.

   Take the millstones and grind meal. Is.16.

      We say, to grind meal, but this is an elliptical phrase. The true
                      phrase is, to grind corn to meal.

   2. To break and reduce to small pieces by the teeth.

   3. To sharpen by rubbing or friction; to wear off the substance of a
   metallic instrument, and reduce it to a sharp edge by the friction of a
   stone; as, to grind an ax or scythe.

   4. To make smooth; to polish by friction; as, to grind glass.

   5. To rub one against another.

   Harsh sounds--and the grinding of one stone against another, make a
   shivering or horror in the body and set the teeth on edge.

   6. To oppress by severe exactions; to afflict cruelly; to harass; as,
   to grind the faces of the poor Is.3.

   7. To crush in pieces; to ruin. Matt.21.

   8. To grate; as grinding pains.

      GRIND, v.i. To perform the operation of grinding; to move a mill.

   the grinding jaws.

   2. To be ground or pulverized by friction.

   Corn will not grind well before it is dry.

   3. To be polished and made smooth by friction. Glass grinds smooth.

   4. To be sharpened by grinding. Steel grinds to a fine edge.

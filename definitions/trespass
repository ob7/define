[1]trespass

   TRES'PASS, v.i. [L. trans, beyond, and passer, to pass.]

   1. Literally, to pass beyond; hence primarily, to pass over the
   boundary line of another's land; to enter unlawfully upon the land of
   another. A man may trespass by walking over the ground of another, and
   the law gives a remedy for damages sustained.

   2. To commit any offense or to do any act that injures or annoys
   another; to violate any rule of rectitude to the injury of another.

   If any man shall trespass against his neighbor, and an oath be laid
   upon him-- 1 Kings 8. See Luke 17. 3. and 4.

   3. In a moral sense, to transgress voluntarily any divine law or
   command; to violate any known rule of duty.

   In the time of his disease did he trespass yet more. 2 Chron.28.

   We have trespassed against our God. Ezra 10.

   4. To intrude; to go too far; to put to inconvenience by demand or
   importunity; as, to trespass upon the time or patience of another.

    TRES'PASS, n. In law, violation of another's rights, not amounting to
      treason, felony, or misprision of either. Thus to enter another's
   close, is a trespass; to attack his person is a trespass. When violence
          accompanies the act, it is called a trespass vi et armis.

   1. Any injury or offense done to another.

   If ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father
   forgive your trespasses. Matt.6.

   2. Any voluntary transgression of the moral law; any violation of a
   known rule of duty; sin. Col.2.

   You hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins. Eph.2.

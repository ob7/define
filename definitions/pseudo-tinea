   PSEUDO-TINEA, n. In natural history, the name of a remarkable species
   of insect or larva, resembling a moth. It feeds on wax, and is a
   terrible enemy to bees, as it enters the hive and sometimes compels the
   bees to abandon it, being covered with a coat that is impervious to
   their stings.

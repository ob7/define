   1. A gloomy state of mind, often a gloomy state that is of some
   continuance, or habitual; depression of spirits induced by grief;
   dejection of spirits. This was formerly supposed to proceed from a

   continuance, is a disease, sometimes accompanied with partial insanity.
   Cullen defines it, partial insanity without dyspepsy.

    In nosology, mental-alienation restrained to a single object or train
       of ideas, in distinction from mania, in which the alienation is
                                  general.

   Moon-struck madness, moping melancholy.

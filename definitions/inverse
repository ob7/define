[1]inverse

   INVERSE, a. invers'. [L. inversus. See Invert.]

   Inverted; reciprocal. Inverse proportion or ratio, is when the effect
   or result of any operation is less in proportion as the cause is
   greater, or is greater in proportion as the cause is less. Thus the
   time in which a quantity of work may be performed, will be less in
   proportion as the number of workmen is greater, and greater in
   proportion as the number of workmen is less. If ten men can perform a
   certain quantity of work in six days,then twenty men will perform the
   same work in three days. Inverse proportion is opposed to direct.

[1]synonymous

   SYNON'YMOUS, a. Expressing the same thing; conveying the same idea. We
   rarely find two words precisely synonymous. Wave and billow are
   sometimes synonymous, but not always. When we speak of the large
   rolling swell of the sea, we may call it a wave or a billow; but when
   we speak of the small swell of a pond, we may call it a wave, but we
   may not call it a billow.

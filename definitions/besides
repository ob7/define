[1]besides

   BESI'DES, prep. Over and above; separate or distinct from.

   And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine. Gen.26.

   Note. This word, though radically the same as beside, and a corruption
   of it, ought not to be confounded with it, for it is never used in the
            senses explained under beside, except in the second.

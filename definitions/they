[1]they

   THEY, pron. plu.; objective case, them.]

   1. The men, the women, the animals, the things. It is never used
   adjectively, but always as a pronoun referring to persons, or as a
   substitute referring to things.

   They and their fathers have transgressed against me. Ezek.2.

   They of Italy salute you. Heb.13.

   Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness. Matt.5.

   2. It is used indefinitely, as our ancestors used man, and as the
   French use on. They say, [on dit,] that is, it is said by persons,
   indefinitely.

[1]bay-salt

   BAY-SALT, is salt which crystallizes or receives its consistence from
   the heat of the sun or action of the air. It forms in pits or basins,
   and from this circumstance receives its denomination. It appears first
   in a slight incrustation upon the surface of the water in which salt is
   dissolved. This crust thickens and hardens, till the crystallization is
   perfected, which takes place, in eight, ten or fifteen days.

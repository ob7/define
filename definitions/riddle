   RID'DLE, n. [See Cradle.]

   An instrument for cleaning grain, being a large sieve with a perforated
   button, which permits the grain to pass through it, but retains the
   chaff.

    RID'DLE, v.t. To separate, as grain from the chaff with a riddle; as,
    to riddle wheat. [Note. The machines now used have nearly superseded
                                the riddle.]

                           RID'DLE, n. [See Read.]

   solved by conjecture; a puzzling question; an ambiguous proposition.
   Judges 14.

   2. Any thing ambiguous or puzzling.

     RID'DLE, v.t. To solve; to explain; but we generally use unriddle,
                            which is more proper.

   Riddle me this, and guess him if you can.

       RID'DLE, v.i. To speak ambiguously, obscurely or enigmatically.

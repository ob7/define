   COME, v.i.

   1. To move towards; to advance near, in any manner, and from any
   distance. We say, the men come this way, whether riding or on foot; the
   wind comes from the west; the ship comes with a fine breeze; light
   comes from the sun. It is applicable perhaps to every thing susceptible
   of motion, and is opposed to go.

   2. To draw nigh; to approach; to arrive; to be present

   Come thou and all thy house into the ark. Gen. 7.

   All my time will I wait, till my change come. Job 14.

   When shall I come and appear before God? Ps. 42.

   Then shall the end come. Matt. 24.

   Thy kingdom come; thy will be done. Matt. 6.

   The time has come.

   3. To advance and arrive at some state or condition; as, the ships came
   to action; the players came to blows; is it come to this?

   His sons come to honor and he knoweth it not. Job 14.

   I wonder how he came to know what had been done; how did he come by his
   knowledge? the heir comes into possession of his estate; the man will
   come in time to abhor the vices of his youth, or he will come to be
   poor and despicable, or to poverty.

   In these and similar phrases, we observe the process or advance is
   applied to the body or to the mind, indifferently; and to persons or
   events.

   4. To happen or fall out; as, how comes that? Let come what will. Hence
   when followed by an object or person, with to or on, to befall; to
   light on.

   After all that has come on us for our evil deeds. Ezra 9.

   All things come alike to all. Eccles. 9.

   5. To advance or move into view; to appear; as, blood or color comes
   and goes in the face.

   6. To sprout, as plants; to spring. The corn comes or comes up. In the
   coming or sprouting of malt, as it must not come too little, so it must
   not come too much. So Bacon uses the word; and this use of it coincides
   nearly with the sense of 2 Kings 19:26 and in the same chapter inserted
   in Isaiah 34:27. It is the G. Kiemen, Icelandic kiema, to bud, or
   germinate.

   7. To become.

   So came I a widow.

   8. To appear or be formed, as butter; to advance or change from cream
   to butter; a common use of the word; as, the butter comes.

   9. Come, in the imperative, is used to excite attention, or to invite
   to motion or joint action; come, let us go.

   This is the heir; come, let us kill him.

   When repeated, it sometimes expresses haste; come, come. Sometimes if
   expresses or introduces rebuke.

   As the sense of come is to move, in almost any manner, in its various
   applications, that sense is modified indefinitely by other words used
   in connection with it. Thus with words expressing approach, it denotes
   advancing nearer; with words expressing departure, as from, of, out of,
   &c., it denotes motion from, &c.

   To come about, to happen; to fall out; to come to pass; to arrive. How
   did these tings come about? So the French venir a bout, to come to the
   end, that is, to arrive.

   To come about, to turn; to change; to come round. The wind will come
   about from west to east. The ship comes about. It is applied to a
   change of sentiments.

   On better thoughts, and my urged reasons,

   They are come about, and won to the true side.

   To come again, to return. Gen. 28., Lev. 14.

   To come after, to follow. Matt. 24. Also to come to obtain; as, to come
   after a book.

   To come at, to reach; to arrive within reach of; to gain; to come so
   near as to be able to take or possess. We prize those most who are
   hardest to come at. To come at a true knowledge of ourselves.

   Also, to come towards, as in attacking.

   To come away, to depart from; to leave; to issue from.

   To come back, to return.

   To come by, to pass near; a popular phrase. Also, to obtain, gain,
   acquire; that is, to come near, at or close. Examine how you came by
   all your state.

   This is not an irregular or improper use of this word. It is precisely
   equivalent to possess, to sit by. [See Possess.]

   To come down, to descend.

   The Lord will come down on mount Sinai. Ex 19.

   Also, to be humbled or abased.

   Your principalities shall come down. Jer. 13.

   Come down from thy glory. Jer. 48.

   To come for, to come to get or obtain; to come after.

   To come forth, to issue or proceed from. Gen. 15., Is. 11., Micah 5.

   Also, to depart from; to leave. Mark 9.

   Also, to come abroad. Jer. 4.

   To come from, to depart from to leave. In popular language, this phrase
   is equivalent to, where is his native place or former place of
   residence; where did this man, this animal or this plant originate.

   To come home, that is, to come to home, or the house; to arrive at the
   dwelling. Hence, to come close; to press closely; to touch the
   feelings, interest, or reason.

   Come is an intransitive verb, but the participle come is much used with
     the substantive verb, in the passive form. The end of all flesh is
    come. I am come, thou art come, he is come, we are come, &c. This use
    of the substantive verb, for have, is perhaps too well established to
     be rejected; but have or has should be used in such phrases. In the
    phrase, come Friday, come Candlemas, there is an ellipsis of certain
                      words, as when Friday shall come.

   Come, come, the repetition of come, expresses haste, or exhortation to
   hasten. Sometimes it introduces a threat.

                             COME, n. A sprout.

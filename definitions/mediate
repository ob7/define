   ME'DIATE, a. [L. medius, middle.] Middle; being between the two
   extremes.

   Anxious we hover in a mediate state.

   1. Interposed; intervening; being between two objects.

   Soon the mediate clouds shall be dispelled.

   2. Acting by means, or by an intervening cause or instrument. Thus we
   speak of mediate and immediate cause of its motion; the oar with which
   a man rows a boat is the immediate cause of its motion; but the rower
   is the mediate cause, acting by means of the oar.

     ME'DIATE, v.i. To interpose between parties, as the equal friend of
    each; to act indifferently between contending parties, with a view to
   reconciliation; to intercede. The prince that mediates between nations
           and prevents a war, is the benefactor of both parties.

   1. To be between two. [Little used.]

   ME'DIATE, v.t. To effect by mediation or interposition between parties;
                           as, to mediate a peace.

   1. To limit by something in the middle. [Not used.]

   COAL, n.

   1. A piece of wood, or other combustible substance, ignited, burning,
   or charred. When burning or ignited, it is called a live coal, or
   burning coal, or coal of fire. When the fire is extinct, it is called
   charcoal.

   2. In the language of chimists, any substance containing oil, which has
   been exposed to a fire in a close vessel, so that its volatile matter
   is expelled, and it can sustain a red heat without further
   decomposition.

   3. In mineralogy, a solid, opake, inflammable substance, found in the
   earth, and by way of distinction called fossil coal. It is divided by
   recent mineralogists into three species, anthracite or glance coal,
   black or bituminous coal, and brown coal or lignite; under which are
   included many varieties, such as cannel coal, bovey coal, jet, &c.

                                 COAL, v.t.

   1. To burn to coal, or charcoal; to char.

   2. To mark or delineate with charcoal.

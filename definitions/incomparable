[1]incomparable

   INCOM'PARABLE, a. [in and comparable.] That admits of no comparison
   with others; usually in a good sense, but it may be properly used in a
   bad sense. When we say, an incomparable man, we mean a man of good
   qualities, or of some excellence that raises him above comparison or
   equality with others. So we say, incomparable excellence, virtue, wit,
   &c. But incomparable baseness or malignity may be used with propriety.

[1]tense

   TENSE, a. tens. [L. tensus, from tendo, to stretch.] Stretched;
   strained to stiffness; rigid; not lax; as a tense fiber.

   For the free passage of the sound into the ear, it is requisite that
   the tympanum be tense.

   TENSE, n. tens. [L. tempus.] In grammar, time, or a particular form of
   a verb, or a combination of words, used to express the time of action,
     or of that which is affirmed; or tense is an inflection of verbs by
    which they are made to signify or distinguish the time of actions or
                                   events.

   The primary simple tenses are three; those which express time past,
   present, and future; but these admit of modifications, which differ in
   different languages. The English language is rich in tenses, beyond any
   other language in Europe.

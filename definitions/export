   EXPO'RT, v.t. [L. exporto; ex and porto, to carry. Porto seems allied
   to fero, and Eng. bear.]

   To carry out; but appropriately, and perhaps exclusively, to convey or
   transport, in traffic, produce and goods from one country to another,
   or from one state or jurisdiction to another, either by water or land.
   We export wares and merchandize from the United States to Europe. The
   Northern States export manufactures to South Carolina and Georgia.
   Goods are exported from Persia to Syria and Egypt on camels.

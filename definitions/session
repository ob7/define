   session at the right hand of God.

   2. The actual sitting of a court, council, legislature, &c.; or the
   actual assembly of the members of these o rany similar body for the
   transaction of business. Thus we say, the court is now in session,
   meaning that the members are assembled for business.

   3. The time, space or term during which a court, council, legislature
   and the like, meet for daily business; or the space of time between the
   first meeting and the prorogation of adjournment. Thus a session of
   parliament is opened with a speech from the throne, and closed by
   prorogation. The session of a judicial court is called a term. Thus a
   court may have two sessions or four sessions annually. The supreme
   court of the United States has one anual session. The legislatures of
   most of the states have one anualsession only; some have more. The
   congress of the United States has one only.

   justices, held for granting licenses to innkeepers or taverners, for
   laying out new highways or altering old ones and the like.

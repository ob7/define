[1]palatine

   PAL'ATINE, a. [L. palatinus, from palatium, palace.] Pertaining to a
   palace; an epithet applied originally to persons holding an office or
   employment in the king;s palace; hence it imports possessing royal
   privileges; as a count palatine.

   In England, formerly, were three counties palatine, Chester, Durham and
   Lancaster; the two former by prescription, the latter by grant of
   Edward III. They were so called, because the proprietors, the earl of
   Chester,the bishop of Durham and the duke of Lancaster, possessed royal
   rights, as fully as the king in his palace. Of these, the county of
   Durham is the only one now remaining in the hands of a subject.

   PAL'ATINE, n. One invested with royal privileges and rights. A palatine
    or count palatine, on the continent of Europe, is one delegated by a
   prince to hold courts of justice in a province, or one who has a palace
    and a court of justice in his own house. In Poland, a palatine may be
                   regarded as the governor of a province.

[1]chose

   CHOSE, n. In law, property in action; a right to possession; or that
   which may be demanded and recovered by suit or action at law. Thus,
   money due on a bond or note is a chose in action; a recompense for
   damage done is a chose in action; the former proceeding from an
   express, the latter from an implied contract. A contract executed is a
   chose in possession; a contract executory conveys only a chose in
   action. A chose local is annexed to a place, as a mill or the like; a
   chose transitory is a thing which is movable.

   CHOSE, s as z, pret. and p. of choose.

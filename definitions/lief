[1]lief

   LIEF, a. [See Love.] Dear; beloved. Obs.

   LIEF, adv. [supra. This word coincides with love, L. lubet, libet, and
   the primary sense is to be free, prompt, ready.]

   Gladly; willingly; freely; used in familiar speech, in the phrase, I
   had as lief go as not. It has been supposed that had in this phrase is
   a corruption of would. At any rate it is anomalous.

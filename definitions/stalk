   STALK, n. [G., a handle, and a stalk or stem. Gr. from the root of
   stall; to set.]

   1. The stem, culm or main body of an herbaceous plant. Thus we speak of
   a stalk of wheat, rye or oats, the stalks of maiz or hemp. The stalk of
   herbaceous plants, answers to the stem of shrubs and tress, and denotes
   that which is set, the fixed part of a plant, its support; or it is a
   shoot.

   2. The pedicle of a flower, or the peduncle that supports the
   fructification of a plant.

   3. The stem of a quill.

                                 STALK, v.i.

   1. To walk with high and proud steps; usually implying the affectation
   of dignity, and hence the word usually expresses dislike. The poets
   however use the word to express dignity of step.

   With manly mein he stalkd along the ground.

   Then stalking through the deep he fords the ocean.

   2. It is used with some insinuation of contempt or abhorrence.

   Stalks close behind her, like a witchs fiend, pressing to be employd.

   Tis not to stalk about and draw fresh air from time to time.

   3. To walk behind a stalking horse or behind a cover.

   The king crept under the shoulder of his led horse, and said, I must
   stalk.

               STALK, n. A high, proud, stately step or walk.

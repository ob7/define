   AN'TI-CHRIST, n. [Gr. against, and Christ.]

   A great adversary of Christ; the man of sin; described

      1John 2:18. 2Thess. 2. Rev. 9. Protestants generally suppose this
    adversary to be the Papal power; and some divines believe that, in a
   more general sense, the word extends to any persons who deny Christ or
              oppose the fundamental doctrines of christianity.

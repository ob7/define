[1]chick-weed

   CHICK-WEED, n. A plant of the genus Alsine, which includes many
   species. The common chick-weed, with white blossoms, affords a
   remarkable instance of the sleep of plants; for, at night, the leaves
   approach in pairs, and inclose the tender rudiments of the young
   shoots. The leaves are cooling and nutritive, and are deemed excellent
   food for persons of a consumptive habit. They are deemed useful also
   for swelled breasts.

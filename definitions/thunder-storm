[1]thunder-storm

   THUN'DER-STORM, n. [thunder and storm.] A storm accompanied with
   lightning and thunder. Thunder clouds are often driven by violent
   winds. In America, the violence of the wind at the commencement, is
   sometimes equal to that of a hurricane, and at this time the explosions
   of electricity are the most terrible. This violence of the wind seldom
   continues longer than a few minutes, and after this subsides, the rain
   continues, but the peals of thunder are less frequent. These violent
   showers sometimes continue for hours; more generally, they are of
   shorter duration.

   THUN'DER-STORM, v.t. [thunder and strike.]

   1. To strike, blast or injure by lightning. [Little used in its literal
   sense.]

   2. To astonish or strike dumb, as with something terrible. [Little used
   except in the participle.]

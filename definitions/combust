   COMBUST, a. When a planet is in conjunction with the sun or apparently
   very near it, it is said to be combust or in combustion. The distance
   within which this epithet is applicable to a planet, is said by some
   writers to be 8 degrees; others say, within the distance of half the
   suns disk.

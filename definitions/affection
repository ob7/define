[1]affection

   AFFEC'TION, n.

   1. The state of being affected. [Little used.]

   2. Passion; but more generally,

   3. A bent of mind towards a particular object, holding a middle place
   between disposition, which is natural, and passion, which is excited by
   the presence of its exciting object. Affection is a permanent bent of
   the mind, formed by the presence of an object, or by some act of
   another person, and existing without the presence of its object.

   4. In a more particular sense, a settle good will, love or zealous
   attachment; as, the affection of a parent for his child. It was
   formerly followed by to or towards, but is now more generally followed
   by far.

   5. Desire; inclination; propensity, good or evil; as, virtuous or vile
   affections. Rom. 1. Gal. 5.

   6. In a general sense, an attribute, quality or property, which is
   inseparable from its object; as, love, fear and hope are affections of
   the mind; figure, weight, &c., are affections of bodies.

   7. Among physicians, a disease, or any particular morbid state of the
   body; as, a gouty affection; hysteric affection.

   8. In painting, a lively representation of passion.

   Shakespeare uses the word for affectation; but this use is not
   legitimate.

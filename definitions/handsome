[1]handsome

   HAND'SOME, a.

   1. Properly, dexterous; ready; convenient.

   For a thief it is so handsome, as it may seem it was first invented for
   him.

   This sense is either from the original meaning of hand, or from the use
     of the hand, or rather of the right hand. In this sense the word is
       still used. We say of a well fought combat and victory, it is a
      handsome affair, an affair well performed, done with dexterity or
                             skill. [See Handy.]

   2. Moderately beautiful, as the person or other thing; well made;
   having symmetry of parts; well formed. It expresses less than beautiful
   or elegant; as a handsome woman or man; she has a handsome person or
   face. So we say, a handsome house; a handsome type.

   3. Graceful in manner; marked with propriety and ease; as a handsome
   address.

   4. Ample; large; as handsome fortune.

   5. Neat; correct; moderately elegant; as a handsome style or
   composition.

   6. Liberal; generous; as a handsome present.

      The applications of this word in popular language are various and
     somewhat indefinite. In general, when applied to things, it imports
      that the form is agreeable to the eye, or to just taste; and when
     applied to manner, it conveys the idea of suitableness or propriety
                                 with grace.

   HAND'SOME, as a verb, to render neat or beautiful, is not an authorized
                                    word.

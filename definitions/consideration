   CONSIDERATION, n. [L. See Consider.]

   1. The act of considering; mental view; regard; notice.

   Let us take into consideration the consequences of a hasty decision.

   2. Mature thought; serious deliberation.

   Let us think with consideration.

   3. Contemplation; meditation.

   The love you bear to Mopsa hath brought you to the consideration of her
   virtues.

   4. Some degree of importance; claim to notice, or regard; a moderate
   degree of respectability.

   Lucan is an author of consideration among the Latin poets.

   5. That which is considered; motive of action; influence; ground of
   conduct.

   He was obliged, antecedent to all other considerations, to search an
   asylum.

   6. Reason; that which induces to a determination.

   He was moved by the considerations set before him.

   7. In law, the reason which moves a contracting party to enter into an
   agreement; the material cause of a contract; the price or motive of a
   stipulation. In all contracts, each party gives something in exchange
   for what he receives.

   A contract is an agreement, upon sufficient consideration. This
   consideration is express or implied; express, when the thing to be
   given or done is specified; implied, when no specific consideration is
   agreed upon, but justice requires it and the law implies it; as when a
   man labors for another, without stipulating for wages, the law infers
   that he shall receive a reasonable consideration. A good consideration
   is that of blood, or natural love; a valuable consideration, is such as
   money, marriage, &c. Hence a consideration is an equivalent or
   recompense; that which is given as of equal estimated value with that
   which is received.

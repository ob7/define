It denotes an agent, originally of the masculine gender, but now applied to men or things indifferently; as in farmer, heater, grater.  At the end names of places, er signifies a man of the place; Londoner is the same as London-man.<p>There is a passage in Herodotus, Melpomene, 110, in which the word wer, vir, a man, is mentioned as used by the Scythians; a fact proving the affinity of the Scythian and the Teutonic nations.<p>"The Scythians call the Amazons Oiorpata, a word which may be rendered, in Greek, menkillers; for oior is the name they give to man, pata signifies to kill."  Pata, in the Burman language, signifies to kill; but it is probable that this is really the English beat.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

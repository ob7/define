[L. doceo.  This word seems to be allied to think, for we say, I think a thing to be so, or I take<p>it to be so.  It seems also to be allied to Sax.teogan, to draw, to tug, L. duco; for we say, to take a likeness, and to draw a likeness.  We use taking also for engaging, attracting.  We say, a child takes to his mother or nurse, and a man takes to drink; which seem to include attaching and holding. We observe that take and teach are radically the same word.]<p><DD>1.

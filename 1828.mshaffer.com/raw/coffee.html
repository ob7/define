The berry of a tree belonging to the genus Coffea, growing in Arabia, Persia, and in other warm climates of Asia and America.  It will grow to the highth of 16 or 18 feet, but its growth is generally stinted to five feet, for the convenience of gathering the fruit.  The stem is upright, and covered with a light brown bark; the branches are horizontal and opposite, crossing each other at every joint, and forming a sort of pyramid.  The flowers grow in clusters at the root of the leaves, and close to the branches; they are of a pure white and of an agreeable odor.  The fruit which is a berry, grows in clusters, along the branches, under the axils of the leaves.<p><DD>2.  A drink made from the berry of the coffee-tree, by decoction.  The berry is first roasted, and then ground in a mill, and boiled.  The use of it is said to have been introduced into France by Thevenot, the traveler, and into England, in 1652, by a Greek servant, called Pasqua.  The best coffee is said to be the Mocha coffee from Arabia Felix.  The coffee of Java, Bourbon and the West Indies constitutes an important article of commerce.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

Going in a circle; following in succession; as rotatory assemblies.<p><DD>[This word is often used, probably by mistake, for rotary.  It may be regularly formed from rotator, but not with the exact sense in which it is used.  With rotator for its original, it would signify causing rather than being in a circular motion.  The true word is rotary.]</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

[from <i>see</i>.]  Perceiving by the eye; knowing; understanding; observing; beholding.<p>[<i>Note</i>.  This participle appears to be used indefinitely, or without direct reference to a person or persons.  "Wherefore come ye to me, <i>seeing</i> ye hate me.?"  Gen. 26.  That is, since, or the fact being that or thus; because that.  In this form of phraseology, <i>that</i> is understood or implied after <i>seeing</i>; why come ye to me, <i>seeing that</i>, ye hate me?  The resolution of the phrase or sentence is, ye hate me; that fact being seen or known by you, why come ye to me? or why come you to me, ye seeing [knowing] that fact which follows, viz. ye hate me.  In this case, <i>seeing</i> retains its participial character, although its relation to the pronoun is somewhat obscured. Originally, <i>seeing</i>, in this use, had direct relation to the speaker or to some other person.  "Mow I know that thou fearest God, <i>seeing</i> thou hast not witheld thy son."  Gen. 22.  Here <i>seeing</i> refers to <i>I</i>, or according to the language of syntax, agrees or accords with <i>I</i>.  I know thou fearest God, for I <i>see</i> thou hast not withheld thine only son; I know thou fearest God by <i>seeing</i>, in consequence of <i>seeing</i> this fact, thou hast not withheld thine only son.  But the use of <i>seeing</i> is extended to cases in which it cannot be referred to a specifec person or persons, in which cases it expresses the notoriety or admission of a fact in general, and is left, like the French <i>on</i>, in the phrases <i>on dit, on voit</i>, without application to any particular person.] </SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

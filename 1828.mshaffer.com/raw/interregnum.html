[L. inter and regnum, rule or reign.]  The time in which a throne is vacant, between the death or abdication of a king and the accession of his successor.  An interregnum, in strictness, can happen only in governments where the king is elective; for in hereditary kingdoms, the reign of the successor commences at the moment of his predecessor;s death or demise.  The word however is used with more latitude.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

[L. claudo, clausi, clausus; Low L.  exclusa. The most correct orthography is sluse.]<p><DD>1.  The stream of water issuing through a flood-gate; or the gate itself.  If the word had its origin in shutting; it denoted the frame of boards or planks which closes the opening of a mill dam; but I believe it is applied to the stream, the gate and channel.  It is a common saying, that a rapid stream runs like a sluse.<p><DD>2.  An opening; a source of supply; that through which any thing flows.  Each sluice of affluent fortune open'd soon.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

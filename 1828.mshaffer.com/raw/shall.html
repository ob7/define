"Ic <i>sceal</i> fram the <i>beon</i> gefullod." I <i>have need</i> to be baptized of thee. "Ic nu <i>sceal singan</i> sar-cwidas." I must now sing mornful songs.<p>     We still use <i>shall </i>and <i>should </i>before another verb in the infinitive, without the sign <i>to</i>; but significance of <i>shall </i>is considerably deflected from its primitive sense. It is now treated as a mere auxiliary to other verbs, serving to form some of the tenses. In the present tense, <i>shall</i>, before a verb in the infinitive, forms the future tense; but its force and effect are different with different persons or personal pronouns. Thus in the first person, <i>shall</i> simply foretells or declares what will take place; as, I or we <i>shall</i> ride to town on Monday. This declaration simply informs another of a fact that is to take place. The sense of <i>shall</i> here is changed from an expression of need or duty, to that of previous statement or information, grounded on intention or resolution. When uttered with emphasis, "I <i>shall</i> go," it expresses firm determination, but not a promise.<p>           2. In the second and third persons, <i>shall</i> implies a promise, command or determination. "You<i> shall </i>receive your wages," "he <i>shall </i>receive his wages," imply that you or he <i>ought </i>to receive them; but usage gives these phrases the force of a <i>promise </i>in the person uttering them.<p>     When <i>shall</i> is uttered with emphasis in such phrases, it expresses determination in the speaker, and implies an authority to enforce the act. "Do you refuse to go? Does he refuse to go? But you or he <i>shall</i> go."<p>           3. <i>Shall I go, shall he go</i>, interrogatively, asks, for permission or direction. But <i>shall you go</i>, asks for information of another's intention.<p>           4. But after another verb, <i>shall</i>, in the third person, simply foretells. He says that he <i>shall</i> leave town to-morrow. So also in the second person; you say that you <i>shall</i> ride to-morrow.<p>           5. After <i>if</i>, and some verbs which expresscondition or supposition, <i>shall</i>, in all the persons, simply foretells; as,<p>If<b> </b> I <i>shall</i> say, or we<i> shall</i> say,<i>  </i><p>    Thou <i>shalt</i> say, ye or you <i>shall</i> say,</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

It is more consonant, however, to the genius of our language, to treat these and similar words as compounds.  In some cases, as before the participles of intransitive verbs, ill must be considered as a part of the compound, as in ill-looking.  When used before the perfect participle, ill is to be considered as an adverb, or modifying word, or to be treated as a part of the compound; as in ill-bred, ill-governed, ill-fated, ill-favored, ill-formed, ill-minded.  In these and all similar connections, it might be well to unite the two words in a compound by a hyphen.  As ill may be prefixed to almost any participle, it is needless to attempt to collect a list of such words for insertion.<p> </SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

[L. observatio.  See Observe.]<p><DD>1.  The act of observing or taking notice; the act of seeing or of fixing the mind on any thing.  We apply the word to simple vision, as when one says, a spot on the sun's disk did not fall under his observation; or to the notice or cognizance of the mind, as when one says, the distinction made by the orator escaped his observation.  When however it expresses vision, it often represents a more fixed or particular view than a mere transient sight; as an astronomical observation.<p><DD>2.  Notion gained by observing; the effect or result of seeing or taking cognizance in the mind, and either retained in the mind or expressed in words; inference or something arising out of the act of seeing or noticing, or that which is produced by thinking and reflecting on a subject; note; remark; animadversion.  We often say, I made the observation in my own mind; but properly an observation is that which is expressed as the result of viewing or of thinking.<p><DD>In matters of human prudence, we shall find the greatest advantage by making wise observations on our conduct.<p><DD>3.  Observance; adherence to in practice; performance of what is prescribed.<p><DD>He freed the christian church from the external observation and obedience of legal precepts not formally moral.<p><DD>4.  In navigation, the taking of the altitude of the sun or a star in order to find the latitude.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

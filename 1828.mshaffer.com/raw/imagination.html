[L. imaginatio.]  The power or faculty of the mind by which it conceives and forms ideas of things communicated to it by the organs of sense.<p><DD><DD> Imagination I understand to be the representation of an individual thought.<p><DD><DD> Our simple apprehension of corporeal objects, if present, is sense; if absent, is imagination [conception.]<p><DD><DD> Imagination, in its proper sense,signifies a lively conception of objects of sight.  It is distinguished from conception, as a part from a whole.<p><DD>The business of conception is to present us with an exact transcript of what we have felt or perceived.  But we have also a power of modifying our conceptions, by combining the parts of different ones so as to form new wholes of our own creation.  I shall employ the word imagination to express this power. I apprehend this to be the proper sense of the word, if imagination be the power which gives birth to the productions of the poet and the painter.<p><DD>We would define imagination to be the will working on the materials of memory; not satisfied with following the order prescribed by nature, or suggested by accident, it selects the parts of different conceptions, or objects of memory, to form a whole more pleasing, more terrible, or more awful,than has ever been presented in the ordinary course of nature.<p><DD>The two latter definitions give the true sense of the word, as now understood.<p><DD>1.  Conception; image in the mind; idea.<p><DD><DD> Sometimes despair darkens all her imaginations.<p><DD><DD> His imaginations were often as just as they were bold and strong.<p><DD>2.  Contrivance; scheme formed in the mind; device.<p><DD><DD> Thou hast seen all their vengeance, and all their imaginations against me. Lam.3.<p><DD>3.  Conceit; an unsolid or fanciful opinion.<p><DD><DD> We are apt to think that space, in itself, is actually boundless; to which imagination, the idea of space of itself leads us.<p><DD>4.  First motion or purpose of the mind. Gen.6.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

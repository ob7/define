[L. firmamentum, from firmus, firmo.]<p><DD>The region of the air; the sky or heavens.  In scripture, the word denotes an expanse, a wide extent; for such is the signification of the Hebrew word, coinciding with regio, region, and reach.  The original therefore does not convey the sense of solidity, but of stretching, extension; the great arch or expanse over our heads, in which are placed the atmosphere and the clouds, and in which the stars appear to be placed, and are really seen.<p><DD>And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.  Gen. 1:6.<p><DD>And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament.  <p>Ibum. 1:14.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

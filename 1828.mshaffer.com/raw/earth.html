Earth, in its primary sense, signifies the particles which compose the mass of the globe, but more particularly the particles which form the fine mold on the surface of the globe; or it denotes any indefinite mass or portion of that matter.  We throw up earth  with a spade or plow; we fill a pit or ditch with earth; we form a rampart with earth.  This substance being considered, by ancient philosophers, as simple, was called an element; and in popular language, we still hear of the four elements, fire, air,earth, and water.<p><DD>2.  In chimistry, the term earth was, till lately, employed to denote a simple elementary body or substance, tasteless, inodorous, uninflammable and infusible.  But it has also been applied to substances which have a very sensible alkaline taste, as lime.  The primitive earths are reckoned ten in number, viz, silex, alumin, lime, magnesia, baryte, strontian, zircon, glucin, yttria and thorina.  Recent experiments prove that most or all of them are compounds of oxygen with bases, some of which appear to possess the properties of metals. In this case the earths are to be considered as metallic oxyds.<p><DD>3.  The terraqueous globe which we inhabit.  The earth is nearly spherical, but a little flatted at the poles, and hence its figure is called an oblate spheroid.  It is one of the primary planets, revolving round the sun in an orbit which is between those of Venus and Mars.  It is nearly eight thousand miles in diameter, and twenty five thousand miles in circumference.  Its distance from the sun is about ninety five millions of miles,and its annual revolution constitutes the year of 365 days, 5 hours, and nearly 49 minutes.<p><DD>4.

Internal with regard to a state or country; domestic, not foreign; as intestine feuds; intestine war; intestine enemies.  It is to be remarked that this word is usually or always applied to evils. We never say, intestine happiness or prosperity; intestine trade,manufactures or bills; but intestine broils, trouble, disorders, calamities, war, &c.  We say, internal peace, welfare, prosperity, or internal broils,war, trade, &c.  This restricted use of intestine seems to be entirely arbitrary.<p><b>INTEST'INE</b>, n.  Usually in the plural, intestines.  The bowels; the canal or tube that extends, with convolutions, from the right orifice of the stomach to the anus.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

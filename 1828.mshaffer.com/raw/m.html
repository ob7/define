It is called a semi-vowel, as the articulation or compression of the lips is accompanied with a humming sound through the nose, which constitutes a difference between this letter and b.  Its sound is uniform; as in man, time, rim.<p><b>M</b> is a numeral letter, and among the ancients stood for a thousand; a use which is retained by the moderns.  With a dash or stroke over it, it stands for a thousand times a thousand, or a million.<p>As an abbreviation, M stands for Marcus, Martius, Manlius or Mutius.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

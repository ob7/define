[L. unus, una, unum; Gr.]<p><DD>One; noting an individual, either definitely, known, certain, specified, or understood; or indefinitely, not certain, known, or specified.  Definitely, as "Noah built an ark of Gopher wood."  "Paul was an eminent apostle."  Indefinitely, as "Bring me an orange."  Before a consonant the letter n is dropped, as a man; but our ancestors wrote an man, an king.  This letter represents an definitely, or indefinitely.  Definitely, as "I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God."  Ex. 6.  Indefinitely, as "the province of a judge is to decide controversies."  An being the same word as one, should not be used with it; "such an one" is tautology; the true phrase is such one.  Although an, a and one, are the same word, and always have the same sense, yet by custom, an and a are used exclusively as a definite adjective, and one is used in numbering.  Where our ancestors wrote an, twa, thry, we now use one, two, three.  So an and a are never used except with a noun; but one like other adjectives, is sometimes used without its noun, and as a substitute for it; "one is at a loss to assign a reason for such conduct."<p><b>AN,</b> in old English authors, signifies if; as, "an it please your honor."  Gr.; L. an, if or whether.  It is probably an imperative, like if, gif, give.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

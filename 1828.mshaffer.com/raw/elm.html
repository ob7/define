[L. ulmus.]  A tree of the genus Ulmus.  The common elm is one of the largest and most majestic trees of the forest, and is cultivated for shade and ornament.  Another species, the fulva, is called slippery elm, from the quality of its inner bark.  One species seems to have been used to support vines.<p><DD><DD>The treaty which William Penn made with the natives in 1682 was negotiated under a large Elm which grew on the spot now called Kensington, just above Philadelphia.  It was prostrated by a storm in 1810, at which time its stem measured 24 feet in circumference.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

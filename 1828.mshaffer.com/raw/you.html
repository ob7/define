[You has been considered as in the plural only, and is so treated in the Saxon grammar. But from the Belgic dialect, it appears to be in the singular as well as the plural, and our universal popular usage, in applying it to a single person with a verb in the singular number, is correct. Yourself is in the singular number.]<p><DD>1. The pronoun of the second person, in the nominative or objective case. In familiar language, it is applied to an individual, as thou is in the solemn style. In the plural, it is used in the solemn style in the objective case.<p><DD><DD>In vain you tell your parting lover, you wish fair winds may waft him over.<p><DD><DD>He that despiseth you, despiseth me. Luke 10.<p><DD>2. You is used, like on in French, for any one. This at a distance looks like a rock; but as you approach it, you see a little cabin.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

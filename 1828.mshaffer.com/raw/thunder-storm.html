[thunder and storm.]  A storm accompanied with lightning and thunder.  Thunder clouds are often driven by violent winds.  In America, the violence of the wind at the commencement, is sometimes equal to that of a hurricane, and at this time the explosions of electricity are the most terrible.  This violence of the wind seldom continues longer than a few minutes, and after this subsides, the rain continues, but the peals of thunder are less frequent.  These violent showers sometimes continue for hours; more generally, they are of shorter duration.<p><b>THUN'DER-STORM</b>,  v.t. [thunder and strike.]<p><DD>1.

To emit rays of light; to give light; to beam with steady radiance; to exhibit lightness or splendor; as, the sun <i>shines</i> by day; the moon <i>shines</i> by night. <i>Shining</i> differs from <i>sparkling, glistening, glittering</i>, as it usually implies a steady radiation or emission of light, whereas the latter words usually imply irregular or interrupted radiation.

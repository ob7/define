[Gr.]  A half sphere; one half of a sphere or globe, when divided by a plane passing through its center.  In astronomy, one half the mundane sphere.  The equator divides the sphere into two equal parts.  That on the north is called the northern hemisphere; the other, the southern.  So the horizon divides the sphere into the upper and lower hemispheres.  Hemisphere is also used for a map or projection of half the terrestrial or celestial sphere, and is then often called planisphere.<p><DD>1.

[L. from humeo, to be moist.]<p><DD>1.  Moisture; but the word is chiefly used to express the moisture or fluids of animal bodies, as the humors of the eye.  But more generally the word is used to express a fluid in its morbid or vitiated state.  Hence, in popular speech, we often hear it said,the blood is full of humors.  But the expression is not technical nor correct.<p><DD>Aqueous humor of the eye, a transparent fluid, occupying the space between the crystalline lens and the cornea, both before and behind the pupil.<p><DD>Crystalline humor or lens, a small transparent solid body, of a softish consistence, occupying a middle position in the eye, between the aqueous and vitreous humors, and directly behind the pupil.  It is of a lenticular form, or with double convex surfaces, and is the principal instrument in refracting the rays of light, so as to form an image on the retina.<p><DD>Vitreous humor of the eye, a fluid contained in the minute cells of a transparent membrane, occupying the greater part of the cavity of the eye, and all the space between the crystalline and the retina.<p><DD>2.  A disease of the skin; cutaneous eruptions.<p><DD>3. Turn of mind; temper; disposition, or rather a peculiarity of disposition often temporary; so called because the temper of mind has been supposed to depend on the fluids of the body.  Hence we say, good humor; melancholy humor; peevish humor.  Such humors, when temporary, we call freaks, whims, caprice.  Thus a person characterized by good nature may have a fit of ill humor; and an ill natured person may have a fit of good humor. So we say, it was the humor of the man at the time; it was the humor of the multitude.<p><DD>4.  That quality of the imagination which gives to ideas a wild or fantastic turn, and tends to excite laughter or mirth by ludicrous images or representations. Humor is less poignant and brilliant than wit; hence it is always agreeable. Wit,directed against folly, often offends by its severity; humor makes a man ashamed of his follies, without exciting his resentment. Humor may be employed solely to raise mirth and render conversation pleasant, or it may contain a delicate kind of satire. <p><DD>5.  Petulance; peevishness; better expressed by ill humor.<p><DD><DD> Is my friend all perfection? has he not humors to be endured?<p><DD>6.  A trick; a practice or habit.<p><DD><DD> I like not the humor of lying.<p><b>HU'MOR</b>, v.t.  To gratify by yielding to particular inclination, humor,wish or desire; to indulge by compliance. We sometimes humor children to their injury or ruin.  The sick,the infirm, and the aged often require to be humored.<p><DD>1.  To suit; to indulge; to favor by imposing no restraint, and rather contributing to promote by occasional aids.  We say, an actor humors his part, or the piece.<p><DD><DD> It is my part to invent,and that of the musicians to humor that invention.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

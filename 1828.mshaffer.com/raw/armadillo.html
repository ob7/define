This animal has neither fore-teeth, nor dog-teeth; it is covered with a hard, bony shell, divided into movable belts, except on the forehead, shoulders and haunches, where it is not movable.  The belts are connected by a membrane, which enables the animal to roll itself up like a hedge hog.  These animals burrow in the earth, where they lie during the day time, seldom going abroad except at night.  They are of different sizes; the largest 3 feet in length, without the tail.  They subsist chiefly on fruits and roots; sometimes on insects and flesh.  When attacked, they roll themselves into a ball, presenting their armor on all sides to any assailant; but they are inoffensive, and their flesh is esteemed good food.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

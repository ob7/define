[L.] In a general sense, the separation of the parts of a body which, in the natural structure, are united; or the reduction of concrete bodies into their smallest parts, without regard to solidity or fluidity. Thus we speak of the dissolution of salts in water, of metals in nitro-muriatic acid, and of ice or butter by heat; in which cases, the dissolution is effected by a menstruum or particular agent. We speak so of the dissolution of flesh or animal bodies, when the parts separate by putrefaction. Dissolution then is, <p><DD>1. The act of liquefying or changing from a solid to a fluid state by heat; a melting; a thawing; as the dissolution of snow and ice, which converts them into water.<p><DD>2. The reduction of a body into its smallest parts, or into very minute parts, by a dissolvent or menstruum, as of a metal by nitro-muricatic acid, or of slats in water.<p><DD>3. The separation of the parts of a body by putrefaction, or the analysis of the natural structure of mixed bodies, as of animal or vegetable substances; decomposition.<p><DD>4. The substance formed by dissolving a body in a menstruum. [This is now called a solution.]<p><DD>5. Death; the separation of the soul and body.<p><DD>6. Destruction; the separation of the parts which compose a connected system, or body; as the dissolution of the world, or of nature; the dissolution of government.<p><DD>7. The breaking up of an assembly, or the putting an end to its existence. <p><DD><DD>Dissolution is the civil death of parliament.<p><DD>8. Looseness of manners; dissipation. In this latter sense the word is obsolete, dissoluteness being substituted.<p><DD>9. Dissolution of the blood, in medicine, that state of the blood, in which it does not readily coagulate, no its cooling out of the body, as in malignant fevers.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

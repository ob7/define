The primary sense is to stretch, to extend, to shoot, hence to direct the eye.  We observe its primary sense is nearly the same as that of seek.  Hence, to look for is to seek.]<p><DD>1.  To direct the eye towards an object, with the intention of seeing it.<p><DD>When the object is within sight, look is usually followed by on or at.  We look on or at a picture; we look on or at the moon; we cannot look on or at the unclouded sun, without pain.<p><DD>At, after look, is not used in our version of the Scriptures.  In common usage, at or on is now used indifferently in many cases, and yet in other cases, usage has established a preference.  In general, on is used in the more solemn forms of expression.  Moses was afraid to look on God.  The Lord look on you and judge.  In these and similar phrases, the use of at would be condemned, as expressing too little solemnity.<p><DD>In some cases, at seems to be more properly used before very distant objects; but the cases can hardly be defined.<p><DD>The particular direction of the eye is expressed by various modifying words; as, to look down, to look up, to look back to look forward, to look from, to look round, to look out, to look under.  When the object is not in sight, look is followed by after, or for.  Hence, to look after, or look for, is equivalent to seek or search, or to expect.<p><DD>2.

To transfer property or the exclusive right of possession to another for an equivalent in money. It is correlative to <i>buy</i>, as one party <i>buys</i> what the other <i>sells</i>. It is distinguished from <i>exchange </i>or<i> barter</i>, in which one commodity is given for another; wheras in <i>selling</i> the consideration is money, or its representative in current notes. To this distinction there may be certain exceptions. "Esau <i>sold</i> his birthright to Jacob for a mess of pottage." But this is unusual. "Let us <i>sell</i> Joseph to the Ishmaelites- And they <i>sold</i> him for twenty pieces of silver."  Gen. 37.<p>     Among the Hebrews, parents had power to <i>sell</i> their children.<p>           2. To betray; to deliver or surrender for money or reward; as, to <i>sell</i> one's country.<p>           3. To yield or give for a certain consideration. the troops fought like lions, and <i>sold</i> their lives dearly. that is, they yielded their lives, but first destroyed many, which made it a dear purchase for their enemies.<p>           4.

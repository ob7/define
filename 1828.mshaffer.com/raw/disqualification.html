[See Disqualitfy.]<p><DD>1. The act of disqualifying; or that which disqualifies; that which renders unfit, unsuitable or inadequate; as, sickness is a disqualification for labor or study.<p><DD>2. The act of depriving of legal power or capacity; that which renders incapable; that which incapacitates in law; disability. Conviction of a crime is a disqualification for office.<p><DD>3. Want of qualification. It is used in this sense, though improperly. In strictness, disqualification implies a previous qualification; but careless writers use it for the want of qualification, where no previous qualification is supposed. Thus, I must still retain the consciousness of those disqualifications, which you have been pleased to overlook.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

[See Squall.] To cry with a sharp shrill voice. It is used of animals only, and chiefly of swine. It agrees in sense with squeak, except that squeal denotes a more continues cry than squeak, and the latter is not limited to animals. We say, a squealing hog or pig, a squealing child; but more generally a squalling child.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

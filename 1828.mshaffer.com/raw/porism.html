[Gr. acquisition, to gain, a passing, to pass.]<p>In geometry, a name given by ancient geometers to two classes of propositions.  Euclid gave this name to propositions involved in others which he was investigating, and obtained without a direct view to their discovery.  These he called acquisitions, but such propositions are now called corollaries.  A porism is defined, "a proposition affirming the possibility of finding such conditions as will render a certain problem indeterminate or capable of innumerable solutions."  It is not a theorem, nor a problem, or rather it includes both.  It asserts that a certain problem may become indeterminate, and so far it partakes of the nature of a theorem, and in seeking to discover the conditions by which this may be effected, it partakes of the nature of a problem.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

To heed; to regard; to care for.<p><DD>This son of mine not recking danger.<p><DD>[This verb is obsolete unless in poetry.  We observe the primary sense and application in the phrase, "it recks me not," that is, it does not strain or distress me; it does not rack my mind.  To reck danger is a derivative form of expression, and a deviation from the proper sense of the verb.]</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

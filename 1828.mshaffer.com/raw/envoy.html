[L. via; Eng. way, contracted from viag, vag, or wag.]<p><DD>1.  A person deputed by a prince or government, to negotiate a treaty, or transact other business, with a foreign prince or government.  We usually apply the word to a public minister sent on a special occasion, or for one particular purpose; hence an envoy is distinguished from an embassador or permanent resident at a foreign court, and is of inferior rank.  But envoys are ordinary and extraordinary, and the word may sometimes be applied to resident ministers.<p><DD>2.  A common messenger.  [Not in use.]<p><DD>3.  Formerly, a postscript sent with compositions, to enforce them.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

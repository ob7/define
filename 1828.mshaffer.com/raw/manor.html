[L. maneo, to abide.]  The land belonging to a lord or nobleman, or so much land as a lord or great personage formerly kept in his own hands for the use and subsistence of his family.  In these days,a manor rather signifies the jurisdiction and royalty incorporeal,than the land or site; for a man may have a manor in gross, as the law terms it, that is, the right and interest of a court-baron, with the perquisites thereto belonging.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

[L. adverbium, of ad and verbum, to a verb.]<p><DD>In grammar, a word used to modify the sense of a verb, participle, adjective or attribute, and usually placed near it; as, he writes well; paper extremely white.  This part of speech might be more significantly named a modifier, as its use is to modify, that is, to vary or qualify the sense of another word, by enlarging or restraining it, or by expressing form, quality or manner, which the word itself does not express.  The term adverb, denoting position merely, is often improper.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

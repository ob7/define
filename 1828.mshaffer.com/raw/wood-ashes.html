[wood and ashes.] The remains of burnt wood or plants. [This word is used in England to distinguish these ashes from the remains of coal. In the United States, where wood chiefly is burnt, the people usually say simply ashes. But as coal becomes more used, the English distinction will be necessary.]</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

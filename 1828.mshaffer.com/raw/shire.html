In England, a division of territory, otherwise called a county. The <i>shire</i> was originally a division of the kingdom under the jurisdiction of an earl or count, whose authority was entrusted to the <i>sherif</i>. [shire-reeve.] On this officer the goverment ultimately devolved. In the United States, the corresponding division of a state is called a <i>county</i>, but we retain <i>shire</i> in the in the compound <i>half-shire</i>; as when the county court is held in two towns in the same county alternately, we call one of the divisions a <i>half-shire</i>.<p>     In some states, <i>shire</i> as the constituent part of the name of a county, as <i>Berkshire, Hampshire</i>, in Massachusetts. These being the names established by law, we cannot say, the <i>county of Berkshire</i>, and we cannot with propriety say, the <i>caounty of Berks</i>, for there is no county in Massa chusetts thus named.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

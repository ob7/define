[Gr. resembling a violet.]  In chimistry, a peculiar substance recently discovered by Courtois, a manufacturer of salt-peter in Paris. It is obtained from certain sea-weeds or marine plants.  At the ordinary temperature of the atmosphere it is a solid, apparently a simple substance, at least hitherto undecomposed.  It is incombustible, but in combining with several bodies, it exhibits the phenomena of combustion; hence it has been considered a supporter of combustion.  Like chlorine, it destroys vegetable colors,but with less energy.  Its color is bluish black or grayish black, of a metallic luster.  It is often in scales, resembling those of micaceous iron ore;  sometimes in brilliant rhomboidal plates, or in elongated octahedrons.  Its taste is acrid, and it is somewhat poisonous.  It is fusible at 225 deg. of Fahrenheit.  The color of its vapor is a beautiful violet,whence its name.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

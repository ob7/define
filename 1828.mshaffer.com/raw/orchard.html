[See Yard.]<p><DD>An inclosure for fruit trees.  In Great Britain, a department of the garden appropriated to fruit trees of all kinds, but chiefly to apple trees.  In America, any piece of land set with apple trees, is called an orchard; and orchards are usually cultivated land, being either grounds for mowing or tillage.  In some parts of the country, a piece of ground planted with peach trees is called a peach orchard.  But in most cases, I believe the orchard in both countries is distinct from the garden.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

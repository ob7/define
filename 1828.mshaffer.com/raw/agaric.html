[Gr.]<p><DD>In botany, mushroom, a genus of funguses, containing numerous species.  Mushrooms grow on trees, or spring from the earth; of the latter species some are valued as articles of food; others are poisonous. The name was originally given to a fungus growing on the larch.  This species is now frequent in the shops, and distinguished by the name of female agaric.  From this fungus is extracted a turpentine, of which three fourths of its weight is a resinous substance; the rest, a slimy, mucilaginous, earthy matter, tenacious and almost insoluble in water.  It is used in dyeing, but is little esteemed in medicine.<p><DD>The Agaric of the oak is called touch-wood, from its readiness to take fire.<p><DD>Agaric mineral, a calcarious earth, or carbonate of lime, resembling a fungus in color and texture; found in fissures of rocks, and on the roofs of caverns.  It is sometimes used as an astringent in fluxes, and a styptic in hemorrhages.  It occurs in a loose semi-indurated form, white or whitish red, or yellow, light and friable.  Kirwan mentions three varieties.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

In architecture, the Composite order is the last of the five orders of columns; so called because its capital is composed out of those of the other orders or columns, borrowing a quarter-round from the Tuscan and Doric, a row of leaves from the Corinthian, and volutes from the Ionic.  Its cornice has simple modillions or dentils.  It is called also the Roman or the Italic order.<p><DD>Composite numbers are such as can be measured exactly by a number exceeding unity, as 6 by 2 or e; so that r is the lowest composite number.  Composite numbers between themselves, are those which have a common measure besides unity; as 12 and 15, both which are measured by e.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

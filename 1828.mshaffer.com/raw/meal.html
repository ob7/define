Meal primarily includes the bran as well as the flour. Since bolting has been generally practiced, the word meal is not generally applied to the finer part, or flour, at least in the United States, though I believe it is sometimes so used.  In New England, meal is now usually applied to ground maiz, whether bolted or unbolted, called Indian meal, or corn-meal.  The words wheat-meal,and rye-meal are rarely used,though not wholly extinct; and meal occurs also in oatmeal.<p><DD>2. Flour; the finer part of pulverized grain.<p><DD>[This sense is now uncommon.]<p><b>MEAL</b>, v.t.  To sprinkle with meal, or to mix meal with.

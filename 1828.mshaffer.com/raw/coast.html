The exterior line, limit or border of a country, as in Scripture.  From the river to the uttermost sea shall your coast be.  Deut. 11.  And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim.  Numb. 24.  Hence the word may signify the whole country within certain limits.  Ex. 10:4.<p><DD>2.  The edge or margin of the land next to the sea; the sea-shore.  This is the more common application of the word; and it seems to be used for sea-coast, the border of the sea.  Hence it is never used for the bank of a river.<p><DD>3.  A side; applied to objects indefinitely, by Bacon and Newton.  This is a correct use of the word, but now obsolete.<p><DD>4.  The country near the sea-shore; as, populous towns along the coast.<p><DD><DD>The coast is clear, is a proverbial phrase signifying, the danger is over; the enemies have marched off, or left the coast.<p><b>COAST</b>, v.i.<p><DD>1.  To sail near a coast; to sail by or near the shore, or in sight of land.<p><DD><DD>The ancients coasted only in their navigation.<p><DD>2.  To sail from port to port in the same country.<p><b>COAST</b>, v.t.  <p><DD>1.  To sail by or near to; as, to coast the American shore.<p><DD>2.  To draw near; to approach; to follow.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

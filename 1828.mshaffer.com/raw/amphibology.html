[Gr. speech.]<p><DD>A phrase or discourse, susceptible of two interpretations; and hence, a phrase of uncertain meaning.  Amphibology arises from the order of the phrase, rather than from the ambiguous meaning of a word which is called equivocation.  We have an example in the answer of the oracle to Pyrrhus.  "Aio te Romanos vincere posse."  Here te and Romanos, may either of them precede or follow vincere posse, and the sense may be either, you may conquer the Romans, or the Romans may conquer you.  The English language seldom admits of amphibology.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

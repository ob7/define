A plant of the genus Alsine, which includes many species.  The common chick-weed, with white blossoms, affords a remarkable instance of the sleep of plants; for, at night, the leaves approach in pairs, and inclose the tender rudiments of the young shoots.  The leaves are cooling and nutritive, and are deemed excellent food for persons of a consumptive habit.  They are deemed useful also for swelled breasts.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

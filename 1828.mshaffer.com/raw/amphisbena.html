[Gr. to go; indicating that the animal moves with either end foremost.]<p><DD>A genus of serpents, with the head small, smooth and blunt; the nostrils small, the eyes minute and blackish, and the mouth furnished with small teeth.  The body is cylindrical, destitute of scales, and divided into numerous annular segments; the tail obtuse, and scarcely to be distinguished from the head, whence the belief that it moved equally well with either end foremost.  There are two species; the fuliginosa, black with white spots, found in Africa and America; and the alba, or white species, found in both the Indies and generally in ant-hillocks.  They feed on ants and earth-worms, and were formerly deemed poisonous; but this opinion is exploded.<p><DD>The aquatic amphisben, Gordius aquaticus, Linne, is an animal resembling a horse hair, found in water, and moving with either end foremost.  The vulgar opinion that this is an animated horse-hair is found to be an error.  This hair worm is generated in the common black beetle, in which the parent worm lays its eggs; and is sometimes found in the earth and on the leaves of trees.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

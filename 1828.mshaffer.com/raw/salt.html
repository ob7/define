The radical sense is probably pungent, and if s is radical, the word belongs to the root of L. salio; but this is uncertain.]<p><DD>1.  Common salt is the muriate of soda, a substance used for seasoning certain kinds of food, and for the preservation of meat, &c.  It is found native in the earth, or it is produced by evaporation and crystallization from water impregnated with saline particles.<p><DD>2.  In chimistry, a body compounded of an acid united to some base, which may be either an alkali, an earth, or a metallic oxyd.  Accordingly, salts are alkaline, earthy, or metallic.  Many compounds of this kind, of which common salt, (muriate of soda,) is the most distinguished, exist in nature; but most of these, together with many others not known in nature, have been formed by the artificial combination of their elements.  Their entire number exceeds 2000.  When the acid and base mutually saturate each other, so that the individual properties of each are lost, the compound is a neutral salt; when the acid predominates, it is a super salt; and when the base predominates, it is a sub salt.  Thus we have a subcarbonate, a carbonate, and a supercarbonate of potash.<p><DD>3.  Taste; sapor; smack.<p><DD>We have some salt of our youth in us.<p><DD>4.

See the verb to sack.]<p><DD>1.  A bag, usually a large cloth bag, used for holding and conveying corn, small wares, wool, cotton, hops, and the like.  Gen 42.<p><DD>Sack of wool, in England, is 22 stone of 14lb. each, or 308 pounds.  In Scotland, it is 24 stone of 16 pounds each, or 384 pounds.<p><DD>A sack of cotton, contains usually about 300lb. but it may be from 150 to 400 pounds.<p><DD>Sack of earth, in fortification, is a canvas bag filled with earth, used in making retrenchments in haste.<p><DD>2.  The measure of three bushels.<p><b>SACK,</b> n.  A species of sweet wine, brought chiefly from the Canary isles.<p><b>SACK,</b> n.  [L. sagum, whence Gr.  But the word is Celtic or Teutonic.]<p><DD>Among our rude ancestors, a kind of cloak of a square form, worn over the shoulders and body, and fastened in from by a clasp or thorn.  It was originally made of skin, afterwards of wool.  In modern times, this name has been given to a woman's garment, a gown with loose plaits on the back; but no garment of this kind is now worn, and the word is in disuse.  [See Varro, Strabo, Cluver, Bochart.]<p><b>SACK,</b> v.t.  To put in a sac or in bags.<p><b>SACK,</b> v.t.  [From comparing this word and sack, a bag, in several languages, it appears that they are both from one root, and that the primary sense is to strain, pull, draw; hence sack, a bag, is a tie, that which is tied or drawn together; and sack, to pillage, is to pull, to strip, that is, to take away by violence.]<p><DD>To plunder or pillage, as a town or city.  Rome was twice taken and sacked in the reign of one pope.  This word is never, I believe, applied to the robbing of persons, or pillaging of single houses, but to the pillaging of towns and cities; and as towns are usually or often sacked, when taken by assault, the word may sometimes include the sense of taking by storm.<p><DD>The Romans lay under the apprehension of seeing their city sacked by a barbarous enemy.<p><b>SACK,</b> n.  The pillage or plunder of a town or city; or the storm and plunder of a town; as the sack of Troy.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

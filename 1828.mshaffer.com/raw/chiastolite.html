A mineral, called also macle, whose crystals are arranged in a peculiar manner.  The form of the crystals is a four-sided prism, whose bases are rhombs, differing little from squares.  But each crystal, when viewed at its extremities, or on a transverse section, is obviously composed of two very different substances; and its general aspect is that of a black prism, passing longitudinally through the axis of another prism which is whitish.  The term macle, as the name of a distinct species, applies to the whitish prisms only.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

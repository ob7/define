[Gr. to transfer, over, to carry.]  A short similitude; a similitude reduced to a single word; or a word expressing similitude without the signs of comparison. Thus "that man is a fox," is a metaphor; but "that man is like a fox," is a similitude or comparison. So when I say, "the soldiers fought like lions," I use a similitude.  In metaphor, the similitude is contained in the name; a man is a fox, means, a man is as crafty as a fox.  So we say, a man bridles his anger, that is, restrains it as a bridle restrains a horse.  Beauty awakens love or tender passions; opposition fires courage.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

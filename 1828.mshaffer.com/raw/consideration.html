In law, the reason which moves a contracting party to enter into an agreement; the material cause of a contract; the price or motive of a stipulation.  In all contracts, each party gives something in exchange for what he receives.<p><DD>A contract is an agreement, upon sufficient consideration. This consideration is express or implied; express, when the thing to be given or done is specified; implied, when no specific consideration is agreed upon, but justice requires it and the law implies it; as when a man labors for another, without stipulating for wages, the law infers that he shall receive a reasonable consideration.  A good consideration is that of blood, or natural love; a valuable consideration, is such as money, marriage, &c. Hence a consideration is an equivalent or recompense; that which is given as of equal estimated value with that which is received.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

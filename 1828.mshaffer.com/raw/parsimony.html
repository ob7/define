[L. parsimonia, from parcus, saving,literally close; Eng. park.]  Closeness or sparingness in the use or expenditure of money; sometimes used perhaps in a good sense, implying due or justifiable caution in expenditure, in which sense it differs little from frugality and economy.  More generally, it denotes an excessive caution or closeness; in which case, it is allied to covetousness, but it implies less meanness than niggardliness. It generally implies some want of honorable liberality.<p><DD><DD> The ways to enrich are many; parsimony is one of the best, and yet is not innocent, for it withholdeth men from works of liberality.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

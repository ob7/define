See Mix.]<p><DD>A mingling of bodies; a union by mixing different substances together.  It differs from composition or chimical combination; for admixtion does not alter the nature of the substances mixed, but merely blends them together; whereas in composition, the particles unite by affinity, lose their former properties, and form new compounds, with different properties.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

[L. libertas, from liber, free.]<p><DD>1.  Freedom from restraint, in a general sense, and applicable to the body, or to the will or mind.  The body is at liberty, when not confined; the will or mind is at liberty, when not checked or controlled.  A man enjoys liberty, when no physical force operates to restrain his actions or volitions.<p><DD>2.  Natural liberty, consists in the power of acting as one thinks fit, without any restraint or control, except from the laws of nature.  It is a state of exemption from the control of others, and from positive laws and the institutions of social life.  This liberty is abridged by the establishment of government.<p><DD>3.  Civil liberty, is the liberty of men in a state of society, or natural liberty, so far only abridged and restrained, as is necessary and expedient for the safety and interest of the society, state or nation.  A restraint of natural liberty, not necessary or expedient for the public, is tyranny or oppression.  civil liberty is an exemption from the arbitrary will of others, which exemption is secured by established laws, which restrain every man from injuring or controlling another.  Hence the restraints of law are essential to civil liberty.<p><DD>The liberty of one depends not so much on the removal of all restraint from him, as on the due restraint upon the liberty of others.<p><DD>In this sentence, the latter word liberty denotes natural liberty.<p><DD>4.  Political liberty, is sometimes used as synonymous with civil liberty.  But it more properly designates the liberty of a nation, the freedom of a nation or state from all unjust abridgment of its rights and independence by another nation.  Hence we often speak of the political liberties of Europe, or the nations of Europe.<p><DD>5.  Religious liberty, is the free right of adopting and enjoying opinions on religious subjects, and of worshiping the Supreme Being according to the dictates of conscience, without external control.<p><DD>6.  Liberty, in metaphysics, as opposed to necessity, is the power of an agent to do or forbear any particular action, according to the determination or thought of the mind, by which either is preferred to the other.<p><DD>Freedom of the will; exemption from compulsion or restraint in willing or volition.<p><DD>7.  Privilege; exemption; immunity enjoyed by prescription or by grant; with a plural.  Thus we speak of the liberties of the commercial cities of Europe.<p><DD>8.  Leave; permission granted.  The witness obtained liberty to leave the court.<p><DD>9.  A space in which one is permitted to pass without restraint, and beyond which he may not lawfully pass; with a plural; as the liberties of a prison.<p><DD>10.  Freedom of action or speech beyond the ordinary bounds of civility or decorum.  Females should repel all improper liberties.<p><DD>To take the liberty to do or say any thing, to use freedom not specially granted.<p><DD>To set at liberty, to deliver from confinement; to release from restraint.<p><DD>To be at liberty, to be free from restraint.<p><DD>Liberty of the press, is freedom from any restriction on the power to publish books; the free power of publishing what one pleases, subject only to punishment for abusing the privilege, or publishing what is mischievous to the public or injurious to individuals.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

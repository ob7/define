[L. expio; ex and pio, to worship, to atone; pius, pious, mild.  The primary sense is probably to appease, to pacify, to allay resentment, which is the usual sense of atone in most languages which I have examined.  Pio is probably contracted from pico, and from the root of paco, the radical sense of which is to lay, set or fix; the primary sense of peach, pax. Hence the sense of mild in pius.  But this opinion is offered only as probable.<p><DD>1.  To atone for; to make satisfaction for; to extinguish the guilt of a crime by subsequent acts of piety or worship, by which the obligation to punish the crime is canceled. To expiate guilt or a crime, is to perform some act which is supposed to purify the person guilty; or some act which is accepted by the offended party as satisfaction for the injury; that is, some act by which his wrath is appeased,and his forgiveness procured.<p><DD>2.  To make reparation for; as, to expiate an injury.<p><DD>3.  To avert the threats of prodigies.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

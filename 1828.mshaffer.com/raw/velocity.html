[L. velositas, from velox, swift, allied to volo, to fly.]<p><DD>1.  Swiftness; celerity; rapidity; as the velocity of wind; the velocity of a planet or comet in its orbit or course; the velocity of a cannon ball; the velocity of light.  In these phrases, velocity is more generally used than celerity.  We apply celerity to animals; as, a horse or an ostrich runs with celerity, and a stream runs with rapidity or velocity; but bodies moving in the air or in etherial space, move with greater or less velocity, not celerity.  This usage is arbitrary, and perhaps not universal.<p><DD>2.  In philosophy, velocity is that affection of motion by which a body moves over a certain space in a certain time.  Velocity is in direct proportion to the space over which a body moves.  Velocity is absolute or relative; absolute, when a body moves over a certain space in a certain time; relative, when it has respect to another moving body.  Velocity is also uniform or equal; or it is unequal, that is, retarded or accelerated.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

A species of shark, the squalus squatina.  It is from six to eight feet long, with a large head, teeth broad at the base, but slender and sharp above, disposed in five rows, all around the jaws.  The fish takes its name from its pectoral fins, which are very large and extend horizontally, like wings when spread.  This fish connects the genus of rays, with that of sharks, partaking of the characters of both; but it differs from both in this, that its mouth is placed at the extremity of the head.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

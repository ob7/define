Hurtfulness; noxiousness.<p><DD>1.  Disposition to do harm, or to vex or annoy; as the mischievousness of youth.<p>Mischief denotes injury, harm or damage of less malignity and magnitude than what are usually called crimes.  We never give the name of mischief to theft, robbery or murder.  And it so commonly implies intention in committing petty offenses, that it shocks us to hear the word applied to the calamities inflicted by Providence.  We say, a tempest has done great damage,but not mischief.  In like manner, the adjective mischievous is not applied to thieves, pirates and other felons,but to persons committing petty trespasses and offenses.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

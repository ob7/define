A febril epidemic disease which prevailed in some countries of Europe, but particularly in England, in the 15th and 16th centuries.  Its first appearance was in the army of the earl of Richmond, afterward Henry VII on his landing at Milford haven, in 1485.  The invasion of the disease was sudden, and usually marked by a local affection producing the sensation of intense heat, afterwards diffusing itself over the whole body, and immediately followed by profuse sweating, which continued through the whole course of the disease or till death, which often happened in a few hours.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

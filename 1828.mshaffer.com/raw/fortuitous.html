[L. fortuitus, from the root of fors, forte, fortuna.  The primary sense is to come, to fall, to happen.  See Fare.]<p><DD>Accidental; casual; happening by chance; coming or occurring unexpectedly, or without any known cause.  We speak of fortuitous events, when they occur without our foreseeing or expecting them, and of a fortuitous concourse of atoms, when we suppose the concourse not to result from the design and power of a controlling agent.  But an event cannot be in fact fortuitous.  [See Accidental and Casual.]</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

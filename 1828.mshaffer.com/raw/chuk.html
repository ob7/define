It is the original name of that animal, which our ancestors brought with them from Persia, where it is still in use, Pers. Chuk, Zend, chuk, a hog; Sans. Sugara.  Our ancestors, while in England, adopted the Welsh hwc, hog, but chuck is retained in our popular name of woodchuck, that is, wood hog.  This is a remarkable proof of the original seat of the Teutonic nations.  I have taken chuk from Adelung.  The French cochon may be the same word.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

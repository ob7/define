It is applied to bodies or substances that are naturally soft or flexible, but not fluid.  We never say, a rigid stone or rigid iron, nor do we say, rigid ice; but we say, an animal body or limb, when cold, is rigid.  Rigid is then opposed to flexible, but expresses less than inflexible.<p><DD>2.

Strict; exact; as a rigid law or rule; rigid discipline; rigid criticism.<p><DD>4.  Severely just; as a rigid sentence or judgment.<p><DD>5.

The art or practice of making a map of a particular region, country, or province; or of marking its limits, bounds or position.  Chorography differs from geography, as the description of a particular country differs from that of the whole earth; and from topography, as the description of a country differs from that of a town, city or district.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

In pursuance of; in conformity with; as, agreeable to the order of the day, the house took up the report of the committee.  It is not correctly followed by with.  In this sense, some writers use agreeably, for agreeable, but in violation of the true principles of construction; for the word is an adjective or attribute, in agreement with the last clause of the sentence.  The house took up the report of a committee, (which taking up was) agreeable to the order of the day.  The use of agreeably in this sentence would pervert the sense.<p><DD>3.

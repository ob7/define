The largest species of fowl hitherto discovered; a native of South America.  Some naturalists class it with the vulture; others, with the eagle.  The wings of the largest, when expanded, are said to extend 15 or 18 feet; and the fowl has strength to bear off a calf or a deer.<p><DD>The size of the Condor has been greatly exaggerated.  It is about the size of the Lammer-geyer or vulture of the Alps, which it resembles in its habits.  It is properly a vulture.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

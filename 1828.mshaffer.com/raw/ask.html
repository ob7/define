Gen. 32.<p><DD>This verb can hardly be considered as strictly intransitive, for some person or object is always understood.<p><DD>Ask is not equivalent to demand, claim, and require, at least, in modern usage; much less, is it equivalent to beg and beseech.  The first three words, demand, claim, require, imply a right or supposed right in the person asking, to the thing requested; and beseech implies more urgency, than ask.  Ask and request imply no right, but suppose the thing desired to be a favor.  The French demander is correctly rendered by ask, rather than by deman.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

A sort of animal fat, particularly that which is obtained from animals of the sheep and ox kinds.  We speak of the tallow of an ox or cow, or of sheep.  This substance grows chiefly about the kidneys and on the intestines.  The fat of swine we never call tallow, but lard or suet.  I see in English books, mention is made of the tallow of hogs, [See Cyclopedia, article Tallow;] but in America I never heard the word thus applied.  It may be applied to the fat of goats and deer.  The fat of bears we call bear's grease. Tallow is applied to various uses, but chiefly to the manufacture of candles.<p><b>TAL'LOW</b>, v.t. To grease or smear with tallow.<p><DD>1.  To fatten; to cause to have a large quantity of tallow; as, to tallow sheep.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

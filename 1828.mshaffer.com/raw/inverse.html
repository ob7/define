Inverse proportion or ratio, is when the effect or result of any operation is less in proportion as the cause is greater, or is greater in proportion as the cause is less.  Thus the time in which a quantity of work may be performed, will be less in proportion as the number of workmen is greater, and greater in proportion as the number of workmen is less.

It forms in pits or basins, and from this circumstance receives its denomination.  It appears first in a slight incrustation upon the surface of the water in which salt is dissolved.  This crust thickens and hardens, till the crystallization is perfected, which takes place, in eight, ten or fifteen days.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

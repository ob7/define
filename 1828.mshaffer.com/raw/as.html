But more probably the English word is contracted from als.]<p><DD>1.  Literally, like; even; similar.  "Ye shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil."  "As far as we can see," that is, like far, equally far.  Hence it may be explained by in like manner; as, do as you are commanded.<p><DD>2.  It was formerly used where we now use that.

While; during; at the same time.  "He trembled as he spoke."  But in most of its uses, it is resolvable into like, equal, even, or equally, in like manner.  In some phrases, it must be considered a nominative word, or other words must be supplied.  "Appoint to office such men as deserve public confidence."  This phrase may be elliptical for "such men as those who deserve public confidence."<p><DD>As seems, in some cases, to imply the sense of proportion.  "In general, men are more happy, as they are less involved in public concerns."<p><DD>As, in a subsequent part of a sentence, answers to such; give us such things as you please; and in a preceding part of a sentence, has so to answer to it; as with the people, so with the priest.<p><b>AS,</b> n.

A Roman coin, originally of a pound weight; but reduced, after the first Punic war, to two ounces; in the second Punic war, to one ounce; and by the Papirian law, to half an ounce.  It was originally stamped with the figure of a sheep, sow, or ox; and afterwards with a Janus, on one side, and on the reverse, a rostrum or prow of a ship.<p><DD>3.  An integer; a whole or single thing.  Hence the English ace.  Hence the Romans used the word for the whole inheritance; haeres ex asse, an heir to the whole estate.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

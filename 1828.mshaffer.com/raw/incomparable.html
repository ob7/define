[in and comparable.]  That admits of no comparison with others; usually in a good sense, but it may be properly used in a bad sense.  When we say, an incomparable man, we mean a man of good qualities, or of some excellence that raises him above comparison or equality with others.  So we say, incomparable excellence, virtue, wit, &c.  But incomparable baseness or malignity may be used with propriety.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

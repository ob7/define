The resinous juice which exsudes from the leaves of the Cistus ladanifera, a shrub which grows in Arabia, Candia, and other parts of the Archipelago.  It is collected with a kind of rake, with leather thongs attached to it, with which the shrubs are brushed.  The best sort is in dark-colored black masses, of the consistence of a soft plaster.  The other sort is in long rolls coiled up, harder than the former, and of a paler color.  It is chiefly used in external applications.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

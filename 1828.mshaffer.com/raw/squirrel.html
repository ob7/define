[L., Gr., shade, and tail.] A small quadruped of the genus Sciurus, order of Glires, and class Mammalia. The squirrel has two cutting teeth in each jaw, four toes on the fore feet, and five on the hind feet. Several species are enumerated. Among these are the gray, the red, and the black squirrel. These animals are remarkably nimble, running up tress and leaping from branch to branch with surprising agility. They subsist on nuts, of which they lay up a store for winter, some of them in hollow trees, others in the earth. Their flesh is delicate food.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

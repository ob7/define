[L. berberis.]<p><DD>1.  A plant of the genus berberis, common in hedges; called in England, pipperidge bush.  The berries are used in housewifery, and are deemed efficacious in fluxes and fevers.  The bark dyes a fine yellow, especially the bark of the root.  This plant is pernicious to wheat, the ears of which will not fill, if within the effluvia of the plant; and the influence of this has been known to extend three or four hundred yards.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

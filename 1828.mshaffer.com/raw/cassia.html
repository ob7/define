A genus of plants of many species, among which are the fistula, or purging cassia, and the senna.  The former is a native of Egypt and both Indies; the latter is a native of Persia, Syria and Arabia.  The latter is a shrubby plant, the leaves of which are much used in medicine.  The purging cassia is the pulp of the pods, and is a gentle laxative.<p><DD>Cassia is also the name of a species of Laurus, the bark of which usually passes under the name of cinnamon, differing from real cinnamon chiefly in the strength of its qualities.

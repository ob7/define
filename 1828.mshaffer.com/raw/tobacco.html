[so named from Tabaco, a province of Yucatan, in Spanish America, where it was first found by the Spaniards.]<p>A plant, a native of America, of the genus Nicotiana, much used for smoking and chewing and in snuff.  As a medicine, it is narcotic.  Tobacco has a strong disagreeable smell, and an acrid taste.  When first used it sometimes occasions vomiting; but the practice of using it in any form, soon conquers distaste, and forms a relish for it that is strong and almost unconquerable.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

[L.permanens, permaneo,per and maneo, to remain.]<p>Durable; lasting; continuing in the same state, or without any change that destroys the form or nature of the thing. The laws, like the character of God, are unalterably permanent.  Human laws and institutions may be to a degree permanent, but they are subject to change and overthrow.  We speak of a permanent wall or building, a permanent bridge, when they are so constructed as to endure long; in which examples,permanent is equivalent to durable or lasting, but not to undecaying or unalterable.  So we say, a permanent residence, a permanent intercourse, permanent friendship,when it continues a long time without interruption.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

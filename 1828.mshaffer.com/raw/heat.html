[L. aestus, for haestus, or caestus.]<p><DD>1.  Heat, as a cause of sensation, that is, the matter of heat, is considered to be a subtil fluid, contained in a greater or less degree in all bodies.  In modern chimistry, it is called caloric.  It expands all bodies in different proportions, and is the cause of fluidity and evaporation.  A certain degree of it is also essential to animal and vegetable life.  Heat is latent, when so combined with other matter as not to be perceptible.  It is sensible, when it is evolved and perceptible.<p><DD>2.  Heat, as a sensation, is the effect produced on the sentient organs of animals, by the passage of caloric, disengaged from surrounding bodies, to the organs.  When we touch or approach a hot body, the caloric or heat passes from that body to our organs of feeling, and gives the sensation of heat.  On the contrary, when we touch a cold body, the caloric passes from the hand to that body, and causes a sensation of cold.<p><DD>Note.  This theory of heat seems not to be fully settled.<p><DD>3.  Hot air; hot weather; as the heat of the tropical climates.<p><DD>4.

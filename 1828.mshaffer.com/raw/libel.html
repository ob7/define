A defamatory writing, L. libellus, famosus.  Hence, the epithet being omitted, libel expresses the same thing.  Any book, pamphlet, writing or picture, containing representations, maliciously made or published, tending to bring a person into contempt, or expose him to public hatred and derision.  The communication of such defamatory writing to a single person, is considered in law a publication.  It is immaterial with respect to the essence of a libel, whether the matter of it is true or false, since the provocation and not the falsity is the thing to be punished criminally.  But in a civil action, a libel must appear to be false, as well as scandalous.<p><DD>In a more extensive sense, any blasphemous, treasonable or immoral writing or picture made public, is a libel, and punishable by law.<p><DD>2.

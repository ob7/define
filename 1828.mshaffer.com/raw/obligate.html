[L. obligo; ob and ligo, to bind.]<p><DD>To bind, as one's self, in a moral and legal sense; to impose on, as a duty which the law or good faith may enforce.  A man may obligate himself to pay money, or erect a house, either by bond, by covenant or by a verbal promise.  A man obligates himself only by a positive act of his own.  We never say, a man obligates his heirs or executors.  Until recently, the sense of this word has been restricted to positive and personal acts; and when moral duty or law binds a person to do something, the word oblige has been used.  But this distinction is not now observed.<p><DD>The millions of mankind, as one vast fraternity, should feel obligated by a sense of duty and the impulse of affection, to realize the equal rights and to subserve the best interests of each other.<p><DD>That's your true plan, to obligate the present minister of state.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

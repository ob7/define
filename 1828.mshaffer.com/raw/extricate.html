The primary verb trico is not in the Latin.  We probably see its affinities in the Gr. hair, or a bush of hair, from interweaving, entangling.  I suspect that three is contracted from this root; three for threg, folded, or a plexus.  The same word occurs in intricate and intrigue; Eng. trick.<p> <DD>1.  Properly, to disentangle; hence, to free from difficulties or perplexities; to disembarrass; as, to extricate one from complicated business, from troublesome alliances or other connections; to extricate one's self from debt.<p><DD>2.  To set out; to cause to be emitted or evolved.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

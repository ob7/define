Luck respects persons and their proceedings.  We never say, in a literal sense, that a plant has the luck to grow in a particular place; or a fossil has the luck to be of a particular form.  We say, a person has the good luck to escape from danger; or the ill luck to be ensnared or to suffer loss.  He has had good luck, or bad luck in gaming, fishing or hunting.  Luck, or what we call chance, accident, fortune, is an event which takes place without being intended or foreseen, or from some cause not under human control; that which cannot be previously known or determined with certainty by human skill or power.<p><DD>Consider the gift of luck as below the care of a wise man.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

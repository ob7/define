An artificer who works in timber; a framer and builder of houses, and of ships.  Those who build houses are called house-carpenters, and those who build ships are called ship-carpenters.<p><DD>In New England, a distinction is often made between the man who frames, and the man who executes the interior wood-work of a house.  The framer is the carpenter, and the finisher is called joiner.  This distinction is noticed by Johnson, and seems to be a genuine English distinction.  But in some other parts of America, as in New-York, the term carpenter includes both the framer and the joiner; and in truth both branches of business are often performed by the same person.  The word is never applied, as in Italy and Spain, to a coach-maker.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

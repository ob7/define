We use this verb in a transitive form to express a passive or an intransitive signification. Thus when we say, "the electric fluid pervades the earth," or "either pervades the universe," we mean only that the fluid is diffused through the earth or universe, or exists in all parts of them.  So when we say, "a spirit of conciliation pervades all classes of men," we may mean that such a spirit passes through all classes, or it exists among all classes.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

Ac'my  [Gr.]<p><DD>The top or highest point.  It is used to denote the maturity or perfection of an animal.  Among physicians, the crisis of a disease, or its utmost violence.  Old medical writers divided the progress of a disease into four periods, the arche, or beginning, the anabasis, or increase, the acme or utmost violence, and the paracme, or decline.  But acme can hardly be considered as a legitimate English word.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

[L. vendo.]<p><DD>To sell; to transfer a thing and the exclusive right of possessing it, to another person for a pecuniary equivalent; as, to vend goods; to vend meat and vegetables in market.  Vending differs from barter.  We vend for money; we barter for commodities.  Vend is applicable only to wares, merchandize, or other small articles, not to lands and tenements.  We never say, to vend a farm, a lease, or a bond, a right or a horse.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

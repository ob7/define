[This word seems to be considered by Blackstone as formed from the L. perquisitio.  This is an error.

The legal use of the word in obtaining writs, shows best its true origin; to purchase a writ, is to sue out a writ, that is, to seek it out; for sue, seek, and L. sequor, are all of one origin, and synonymous with chase.]<p><DD>1.

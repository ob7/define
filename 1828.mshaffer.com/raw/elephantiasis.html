[L.and Gr. from elephant.]<p>A species of leprosy, so called from covering the skin with incrustations, like those of an elephant.  It is a chronic and contagious disease, marked by a thickening and greasiness of the legs, with loss of hair and feeling, a swelling of the face, and a hoarse, nasal voice.  It affects the whole body; the bones, as well as the skin, are covered with spots and tumors, at first red, but afterwards black.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

[L. glans, a nut; glandula, a gland.]<p><DD>1.  In anatomy, a distinct soft body, formed by the convolution of a great number of vessels, either constituting a part of the lymphatic system, or destined to secrete some fluid from the blood.  Glands have been divided into conglobate and conglomerate, from their structure; but a more proper division is into lymphatic and secretory.  The former are found in the course of the lymphatic vessels, and are conglobate.  The latter are of various structure.  They include the mucous follicles, the conglomerate glands, properly so called, such as the parotid glands and the pancreas, the liver, kidneys, &c.  The term has also been applied to other bodies of a similar appearance, neither lymphatic nor secretory; such as the thymus and thyroid glands, whose use is not certainly known, certain portions of the brain, as the pineal<p>and pituitary glands, &c.  [See Conglobate and Conglomerate.]<p><DD>2.  In botany, a gland or glandule is an excretory or secretory duct or vessel in a plant.  Glands are found on the leaves, petioles, peduncles and stipules.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

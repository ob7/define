Having the power of passing.<p><DD>1.  In grammar, a transitive verb is one which is or may be followed by an object; a verb expressing an action which passes from the agent to an object, from the subject which does, to the object on which it is done.  Thus, "Cicero wrote letters to Atticus."  In this sentence,the act of writing, performed by Cicero, the agent, terminates on letters, the object.  All verbs not passive, may be arranged in two classes, transitive and intransitive.  In English, this division is correct and complete.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

[See Concubine.] The act or practice of cohabiting, as man and woman, in sexual commerce, without the authority of law, or a legal marriage.  In a more general sense, this word is used to express any criminal or prohibited sexual commerce, including adultery, incest, and fornication.  In some countries, concubinage is a marriage of an inferior kind, or performed with less solemnity than a true or formal marriage; or marriage with a woman of inferior condition, to whom the husband does not convey his rank or quality.  This is said to be still in use in Germany.  <p><DD>In law, concubinage is used as an exception against her that sueth for dower; in which it is alledged that she was not lawfully married to the man in whose lands she seeks to be endowed, but that she was his concubine.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

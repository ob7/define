[from the verb to lead, and stone.]<p><DD>1.  A magnet, an ore of iron; a stone found in iron mines, of a dark or black lead color, and of considerable hardness and weight.

But its peculiar value consists in its communicating to a needle the property of taking a direction to the north and south, a property of inestimable utility in navigation and surveying.<p><DD>2.

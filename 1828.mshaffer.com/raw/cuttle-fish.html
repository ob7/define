A genus of mollusca, called Sepia. They have small arms, with serrated cups, by which they lay fast hold of any thing. They have also two tentacula longer than the arms; the mouth is int he center of the arms, and is horny, and hooked like the bill of a hawk. They feed on sprats, lobsters and other shell-fish. They have a little bladder under the throat, [near the liver, Cuvier,] from which, when pursued, they throw out a black liquor that darkens the water, by which means they escape. Hence cuttle is used for a foul-mouthed fellow; one who blackens the character of another.<p><DD>2. A knife.

The title answers to count [compte] in France, and graaf in Germany. The earl formerly had the government of a shire, and was called shireman.  After the conquest earls were called counts, and from them shires have taken the name of counties.  Earl is now a mere title, unconnected with territorial jurisdiction.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

The sea-cow, or fish-tailed walrus,an animal of the genus Trichechus, which grows to an enormous size; sometimes it is said, to the length twenty three feet.

It has fore feet palmated,and furnished with claws, but the hind part ends in a tail like that of a fish.  The skin is of a dark color,the eyes small, and instead of teeth, the mouth is furnished with hard bones, extending the whole length of the jaws.<p>[There are eight grinders on each side in each jaw.] It never leaves the water, but frequents the mouths of rivers, feeding on grass that grows in the water.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

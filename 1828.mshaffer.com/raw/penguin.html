[L. pinguidine, with fatness.]<p><DD>1.  A genus of fowls of the order of Palmipeds.  The penguin is an aquatic fowl with very short legs, with four toes, three of which are webbed; the body is clothed with short feathers, set as compactly as the scales of a fish; the wings are small like fins, and covered with short scale-like feathers, so that they are useless in flight.  Penguins seldom go on shore, except in the season of breeding, when they burrow like rabbits.  On land they stand erect; they are tame and may be driven like a flock of sheep.  In water they swim with rapidity, being assisted by their wings.  These fowls are found only in the southern latitudes.<p><DD>2.  A species of fruit.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

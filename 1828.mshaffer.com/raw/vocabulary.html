[L. vocabulum, a word.]<p><DD>A list or collection of the words of a language, arranged in alphabetical order and explained; a dictionary_webster1828 or lexicon.  We often use vocabulary in a sense somewhat different from that of dictionary_webster1828, restricting the signification to the list of words; as when we say, the vocabulary of Johnson is more full or extensive than that of Entick.  We rarely use the word as synonymous with dictionary_webster1828, but in the other countries the corresponding word is used and this may be so used in English.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

[L. scientia, from scio, to know.]<p><DD>1.  In a general sense, knowledge, or certain knowledge; the comprehension or understanding of truth or facts by the mind.  The science of God must be perfect.<p><DD>2.  In philosophy, a collection of the general principles or leading truths relating to any subject.  Pure science, as the mathematics, is built on self-evident truths; but the term science is also applied to other subjects founded on generally acknowledged truths, as metaphysics; or on experiment and observation, as chimistry and natural philosophy; or even to an assemblage of the general principles of an art, as the science of agriculture; the science of navigation.  Arts relate to practice, as painting and sculpture.<p><DD>A principle in science is a rule in art.<p><DD>3.  Art derived from precepts or built on principles.<p><DD>Science perfects genius.<p><DD>4.  Any art or species of knowledge.<p><DD>No science doth make known the first principles on which it buildeth.<p><DD>5.  One of the seven liberal branches of knowledge, viz grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music.<p><DD>[Note - Authors have not always been careful to use the terms art and science with due discrimination and precision.  Music is an art as well as a science.  In general, an art is that which depends on practice or performance, and science that which depends on abstract or speculative principles.  The theory of music is a science; the practice of it an art.]</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

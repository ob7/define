A body of people inhabiting the same country, or united under the same sovereign or government; as the English nation; the French nation.  It often happens that many nations are subject to one government; in which case, the word nation usually denotes a body of people speaking the same language, or a body that has formerly been under a distinct government, but has been conquered, or incorporated with a larger nation.  Thus the empire of Russia comprehends many nations, as did formerly the Roman and Persian empires.  Nation, as its etymology imports, originally denoted a family or race of men descended from a common progenitor, like tribe, but by emigration, conquest and intermixture of men of different families, this distinction is in most countries lost.<p><DD>2. A great number, by way of emphasis.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

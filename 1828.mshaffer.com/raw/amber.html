[In 1Kings 10:2-10, the Arabic is rendered spices.  The Arabic word is rendered by Castle, amber, a marine fish, a shield made of skins, crocus and fimus.]<p><DD>A hard semi-pellucid substance, tasteless and without smell, except when pounded or heated, when it emits a fragrant odor.  It is found in alluvial soils, or on the sea shore, in many places; particularly on the shores of the Baltic, in Europe, and at Cape Sable, in Maryland, in the United States.  The ancient opinion of its vegetable origin seems now to be established, and it is believed or known to be a fossil resin.  It yields by distillation an empyreumatic oil, and succinic acid, which sublimes in small white needles.  Its color usually presents some tinge of yellow.  it is highly electrical, and is the basis of a varnish.<p><b>AM'BER,</b> a.  Consisting of, or resembling amber.<p><b>AM'BER,</b> v.t.  To scent with amber.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

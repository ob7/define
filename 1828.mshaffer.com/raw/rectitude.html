[L. rectus, right, straight.]<p><DD>In morality, rightness of principle or practice; uprightness of mind; exact conformity to truth, or to the rules prescribed for moral conduct, either by divine or human laws.  Rectitude of mind is the disposition to act in conformity to any known standard of right, truth or justice; rectitude of conduct is the actual conformity to such standard.  Perfect rectitude belongs only to the Supreme Being.  The more nearly the rectitude of men approaches to the standard of the divine law, the more exalted and dignified is their character.

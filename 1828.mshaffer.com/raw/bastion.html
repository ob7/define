A huge mass of earth, usually faced with <DD>56<p>sods, sometimes with brick, or stones, standing out from a rampart, of which it is a principal part; formerly called a bulwark.  Bastions are solid or hollow.  A flat bastion is made in the middle of the curtain, when it is too long to be defended by the bastions in its extremes.  A cut bastion has its point cut off and instead of it a re-entering angle, or an angle inwards, with two points outward. A composed bastion has two sides of the interior polygon unequal, which makes the gorges unequal.  A demibastion is composed of one face only, which makes the gorges unequal.  A demibastion is composed of one face only, with one flank and a demigorge. A double bastion is one raised on the plane of another.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

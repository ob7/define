Limiting the extent; determinate; positive; express; as a definitive term.<p><DD>2.  Limiting; ending; determining; final; opposed to conditional, provisional, or interlocutory; as a definitive sentence or decree.<p><b>DEFINITIVE</b>, n.  In grammar, an adjective used to define or limit the extent of the signification of an appelative or common noun.  Such are the Latin hic, ille, ipse; the, this and that, in English; le, la, les, in French; il, la, lo in Italian.  Thus tree is an appellative or common noun; the tree, this tree, that tree, designate a particular tree, determinate or known.  Homo signifies man; hic homo, ille homo, a particular man, &c.  But in some languages, the definitives have lost their original use, in a great degree; as in the Greek and French.  Thus La force de la vertu, must be rendered in English, the force of virtue, not the force of the virtue.  The first la is a definitive; the last has no definitive effect.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

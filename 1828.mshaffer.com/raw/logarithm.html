[Gr. ratio, and number.]<p><DD>Logarithms are the exponents of a series of powers and roots.<p><DD>The logarithm of a number is that exponent of some other number, which renders the power of the latter, denoted by the exponent, equal to the former.<p><DD>When the logarithms form a series in arithmetical progression, the corresponding natural numbers form a series in geometrical progression.

In like manner, involution is performed by multiplying the logarithm of any number by the number denoting the required power; and evolution, by dividing the logarithm by the number denoting the required root.<p><DD>Logarithms are the invention of Baron Napier, lord of Marchiston in Scotland; but the kind now in use, were invented by Henry Briggs, professor of geometry in Gresham college at Oxford.  They are extremely useful in abridging the labor of trigonometrical calculations.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

See Discreet.]<p><DD>1. Separate; distinct; disjunct. Discrete proportion is when the ratio of two or more pairs of numbers or quantities is the same, but there is not the same proportion between all the numbers; as 3:6::8:16, 3 bearing the same proportion to 6, as 8 does to 16. But 3 is not to 6 as 6 is to 8. It is thus opposed to continued or continual proportion, as 3:6::12:24.<p><DD>2. Disjunctive; as, I resign my life, but not my honor, is a discrete proposition.<p><b>DISCRETE</b>, v.t. To separate; to discontinue.

In law, the killing of a person by chance, when the killer is doing a lawful act; for if he is doing an unlawful act, it is felony.  As if a man, when throwing bricks from a house into a street where people are continually passing, after giving warning to passengers to take care, should kill a person, this is chance-medley.  But if he gives no warning, and kills a man, it is manslaughter.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

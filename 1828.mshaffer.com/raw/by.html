Near; close; as, sit by me; that house stands by a river. <p>[L. pressus.]<p><DD>2.  Near, in motion; as, to move, go or pass by a church.  But it seems, in other phrases,or with a verb in the past time, to signify past, gone beyond.  "The procession is gone by;" "the hour is gone by;" "John went by."  We now use past as an equivalent word.  The procession is gone past. Gone by is in strictness tautology, as now used; but I apprehend by signifies primarily near.<p><DD>3.  Through, or with, denoting the agent, means, instrument or cause; as, "a city is destroyed by fire;"  "profit is made by commerce;"  "to take by force."  This use answers to that of the Latin per, through, denoting a passing, acting, agency, or instrumentality.<p><DD>4.  "Day by day;" "year by year;" "article by article."  In these phrases, by denotes passing from one to another, or each particular separately taken.<p><DD>5.  "By the space of seven years."  In this phrase, by denotes through, passing or continuing, during.<p><DD>6.  "By this time, the sun had risen."  The word here seems to denote, at, present or come to.<p><DD>7.  According to; as, "this appears by his own account;" "these are good rules to live by."<p><DD>8.  On; as, "to pass by land or water;" "great battles by sea and land."  In the latter phrase, at or on might be substituted for by.<p><DD>9.  It is placed before words denoting quantity, measure or proportion; as, to sell by the pound; to work by the rod or perch; this line is longer by a tenth.<p>    10. It is used to represent the means or instrument of swearing, or affirming; as, to swear by heaven, or by earth; to affirm by all that is sacred.<p>    11. In the phrase, "he has a cask of wine by him," by denotes nearness or presence.<p>    12. "To sit by one's self," is to sit alone, or without company.<p>    13. "To be present by attorney."  In this phrase, by denotes means or instrument; through or in the presence of a substitute.<p>    14. In the phrase, "North by West,"  the sense seems to be north passing to the west, inclining or going westward, or near west.<p>As an adverb, by denotes also nearness, or presence; as, there was no person by, at the time.  But some noun is understood.  So in the phrase, "to pass or go by," there is a noun understood.<p>By and by is a phrase denoting nearness in time; in a short time after; presently; soon.<p><DD><DD>When persecution ariseth, because of the word, by and by, he is offended.  Math.13.<p>By the by signifies, as we proceed or pass.<p>To stand by, is to stand near, or to support.<p>By in lullaby, and in the nursery, a word used in lulling infants to sleep, is evidently allied to words found in many languages, signifying to rest, or be quiet, or to appease; that is, to press, to stop. [L.paco.]<p>By or bye, in by-law.<p>In the common phrase, good-bye, bye signifies passing, going.  The phrase signifies, a good going, a prosperous passage, and it is precisely equivalent to farewell.<p>By is used in many compound words, in most of which we observe the sense of nearness, closeness, or a withdrawing or seclusion.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

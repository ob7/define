The box is covered with glass, to prevent the motion of the card from being disturbed by the wind.<p><DD>6.

There are also compasses of three legs or triangular compasses, cylindrical and spherical compasses with four branches, and various other kinds.<p><DD>7.

This instrument is used in surveying land, and in directing travelers in a desert or forest, miners, &c.<p><DD><DD>Compass-saw, a saw with a brad edge and thin back, to cut in a circular form.<p><b>COMPASS</b>, v.t.<p><DD>1.

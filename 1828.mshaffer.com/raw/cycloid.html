A geometrical curve on which depends the doctrine of pendulums; a figure made by the upper end of the diameter of a circle, turning about a right line. The genesis of a cycloid may be conceived by imagining a nail in the circumference of a wheel; the line which the nail describes in the air, while the wheel revolves in a right line, is the cycloid.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

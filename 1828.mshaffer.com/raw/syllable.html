[L. syllaba; Gr. to comprehend, and to take.]<p><DD>1.  A letter, or a combination of letters, uttered together, or at a single effort or impulse of the voice.  A vowel may form a syllable by itself, as a, the definitive, or in amen; e in even; o in over, and the like.  A syllable may also be formed of a vowel and one consonant, as in go, do, in, at; or a syllable may be formed by a vowel with two articulations, one preceding, the other following it, as in can, but, tun; or a syllable may consist of a combination of consonants, with one vowel or diphthong, as strong, short, camp, voice.<p><DD>A syllable sometimes forms a word, and is then significant, as in go, run, write, sun, moon.  In other cases, a syllable is merely part of a word, and by itself is not significant.  Thus ac, in active, has no signification.<p><DD>At least one vowel or open sound is essential to the formation of a syllable; hence in every word there must be as many syllables as there are single vowels, or single vowels and diphthongs.  A word is called according to the number of syllables it contains, viz.<p><DD>Monosyllable, a word of one syllable.<p><DD>Dissyllable, a word of two syllables.<p><DD>Trisyllable, a word of three syllables.<p><DD>Polysyllable, a word of many syllables.<p><DD>2.  A small part of a sentence or discourse; something very concise.  This account contains not a syllable of truth.<p><DD><DD> Before a syllable of the law of God was written.<p><b>SYL'LABLE</b>, v.t.  To utter; to articulate.  [Not used.]</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

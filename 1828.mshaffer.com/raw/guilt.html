Criminality; that state of a moral agent which results from his actual commission of a crime or offense, knowing it to be a crime, or violation of law.  To constitute guilt there must be a moral agent enjoying freedom of will, and capable of distinguishing between right and wrong, and a wilful or intentional violation of a known law, or rule of duty.  The guilt of a person exists, as soon as the crime is committed; but to evince it to others, it must be proved by confession, or conviction in due course of law.  Guilt renders a person a debtor to the law, as it binds him to pay a penalty in money or suffering.  Guilt therefore implies both criminality and liableness to punishment. Guilt may proceed either from a positive act or breach of law, or from voluntary neglect of known duty.<p><DD>2.  Criminality in a political or civil view; exposure to forfeiture or other penalty.<p><DD><DD> A ship incurs guilt by the violation of a blockade.<p><DD>3.

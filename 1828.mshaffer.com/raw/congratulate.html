[L., grateful, pleasing. See Grace.] To profess ones pleasure or joy to another on account of an event deemed happy or fortunate, as on the birth of a child, success in an enterprise, victory, escape from danger, &c.; to wish joy to another. We congratulate the nation on the restoration of peace.<p><DD>Formerly this verb was followed by to.  The subjects of England may congratulate to themselves. But this use of to is entirely obsolete.  The use of with after this verb, I congratulate with my country, is perhaps less objectionable, but is rarely used.  The intransitive sense of the verb may therefore be considered as antiquated, and no longer legitimate.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

[Eng. to dock.  Originally, a little piece of paper, or a mark or title, affixed to a bag or bundle, expressing its contents.]<p>Primarily, an account of ceremonies.  Hence in present usage, forms of ceremony or decorum; the forms which are observed towards particular persons, or in particular places, especially in courts, levees, and on public occasions.

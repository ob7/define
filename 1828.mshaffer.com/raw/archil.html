A lichen, which grows on rocks, in the Canary and Cape de Verd isles, which yields a rich purple color, not durable, but very beautiful.  It is bruised between stones, and moistened with strong spirit of urine mixed with quick lime.  It first takes a purplish red color, and then turns to blue.  In the first state it is called archil; and in the second, lacmas or litmase, litmus.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

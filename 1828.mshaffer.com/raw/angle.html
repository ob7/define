Gr.]<p><DD>In popular language, the point where two lines meet, or the meeting of two lines in a point; a corner.<p><DD>In geometry, the space comprised between two straight lines that meet in a point, or between two straight converging lines which, if extended, would meet; or the quantity by which two straight lines, departing from a point, diverge from each other.  The point of meeting is the vertex of the angle, and the lines, containing the angle, are its sides or legs.<p><DD>In optics, the angle of incidence is the angle which a ray of light makes with a perpendicular to the surface, or to that point of the surface on which it falls.<p><DD>The angle of refraction is the angle which a ray of light refracted makes with the surface of the refracting medium; or rather with a perpendicular to that point of the surface on which it falls.<p><DD>A right angle, is one formed by a right line falling on another perpendicularly, or an angle of 90 degrees, making the quarter of a circle.<p><DD>An obtuse angle is greater than a right angle, or more than 90 degrees.<p><DD>A rectilineal or right-lined angle, is formed by two right lines.<p><DD>A curvilineal angle, is formed by two curved lines.<p><DD>A mixed angle is formed by a right line with a curved line.<p><DD>Adjacent or contiguous angles are such as have one leg common to both angles, and both together are equal to two right angles.<p><DD>External angles are angles of any right-lined figure without it, when the sides are produced or lengthened.<p><DD>Internal angles are those which are within any right-lined figure.<p><DD>Oblique angles are either acute or obtuse, in opposition to right angles.<p><DD>A solid angle is the meeting of three or more plain angles at one point.<p><DD>A spherical angle is one made by the meeting of two arches of great circles, which mutually cut one another on the surface of the globe or sphere.<p><b>AN'GLE,</b> n.  A hook; an instrument to take fish, consisting of a rod, a line and a hook, or a line and hook.<p><b>AN'GLE,</b> v.i.  <p><DD>1.  To fish with an angle, or with line and hook.<p><DD>2.  v.t. or i.  To fish for; to try to gain by some bait or insinuation, as men angle for fish; as, to angle for the hearts of people, or to angle hearts.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

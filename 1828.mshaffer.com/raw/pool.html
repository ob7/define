[L. palus; Gr. probably from setting, standing, like L. stagnum, or from issuing, as a spring.]<p>A small collection of water in a hollow place, supplied by a spring, and discharging its surplus water by an outlet. It is smaller than a lake, and in New England is never confounded with pond or lake. It signifies with us, a spring with a small basin or reservoir on the surface of the earth.  It is used by writers with more latitude, and sometimes signifies a body of stagnant water.<p><b>POOL</b></SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

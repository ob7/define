The coast or land adjacent to the sea, or to a large lake or river.

We also use the word to express the land near the border of the sea or of a great lake, to an indefinite extent; as when we say, a town stands on the <i>shore</i>. We do not apply the word to land contiguous to a small stream. This we call a bank.<p><b>SHORE</b>,  n.

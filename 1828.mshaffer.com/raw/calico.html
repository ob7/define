[said to be from Calicut, in India.] Cotton cloth.  In England, white or unprinted cotton cloth is called calico.  In the United States, calico is printed cotton cloth, having not more than two colors.  I have never heard this name given to the unprinted cloth.  Calico was originally imported from India, but is now manufactured in Europe and the United States.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

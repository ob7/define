The cabbage-palm, a species of Areca, the oleracea, a native of warm climates.  This tree grows with a straight stem to the height of 170 or 200 feet.  Its branches grow in a circular manner, and the lowermost ones spread horizontally with great regularity.  The fibers of the leaves are used for making cordage and nets.  On the top grows a substance called cabbage, lying in thin, snow-white, brittle flakes, in taste resembling an almond, but sweeter.  This is boiled and eaten with flesh, like other vegetables.  When this is cut out, the tree is destroyed.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

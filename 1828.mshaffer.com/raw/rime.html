[The deduction of this word from the Greek is a palpable error.  The true orthography is rime or ryme; but as rime is hoar frost, and rhyme gives the true pronunciation, it may be convenient to continue the present orthography.<p><DD>1.  In poetry, the correspondence of sounds in the terminating words or syllables of two verses, one of which succeeds the other immediately, or at no great distance.<p><DD>For rhyme with reason may dispense, and sound has right to govern sense.<p><DD>To constitute this correspondence in single words or in syllables, it is necessary that the vowel, and the final articulations or consonants, should be the same, or have nearly the same sound.  The initial consonants may be different, as in find and mind, new and drew, cause and laws.<p><DD>2.  A harmonical succession of sounds.<p><DD>The youth with songs and rhymes, some dance, and some haul the rope.<p><DD>3.  Poetry; a poem.<p><DD>He knew himself to sing, and build the lofty rhyme.<p><DD>4.  A word of sound to answer to another word.<p><DD>Rhyme or reason, number or sense.<p><DD>But from that time unto this season, I had neither rhyme nor reason.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

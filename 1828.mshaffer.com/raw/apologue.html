[Gr. a long speech, a fable.]<p><DD>A moral fable; a story or relation of fictitious events, intended to convey useful truths.  An apologue differs from a parable in this; the parable is drawn from events which pass among mankind, and is therefore supported by probability; an apologue may be founded on supposed actions of brutes or inanimate things, and therefore does not require to be supported by probability.

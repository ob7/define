A military punishment inflicted on criminals for some heinous offense.  It is executed in this manner; soldiers are arranged in two rows, face to face, each armed with a switch or instrument of punishment; between these rows,the offender, stripped to his waist, is compelled to pass a certain number of times, and each man gives him a stroke.  A similar punishment is used on board of ships.  Hence this word is chiefly used in the phrase, to run the gantlet or gantlope.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

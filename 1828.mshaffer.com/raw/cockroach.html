A genus of insects, the Blatta, of several species.  They have four semicrustaceous wings, and resemble the beetle; the head is inflected towards the breast; the feelers are hard like bristles; the elytra and wings are plain and resemble parchment.  These animals are very troublesome, as they enter chests of clothes, meal-tubs, pantries, and infest beds.  They avoid the light, and have a very unsavory smell.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

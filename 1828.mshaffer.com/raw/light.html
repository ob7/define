[L. lux, light and luceo, to shine.  Eng. luck, both in elements and radical sense.]<p><DD>1.  That ethereal agent or matter which makes objects perceptible to the sense of seeing, but the particles of which are separately invisible.  It is now generally believed that light is a fluid, or real matter, existing independent of other substances, with properties peculiar to itself.  Its velocity is astonishing, as it passes through a space of nearly twelve millions of miles in a minute.  Light, when decomposed, is found to consist of rays differently colored; as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.  The sun is the principal source of light in the solar system; but light is also emitted from bodies ignited, or in combustion, and is reflected from enlightened bodies, as the moon.  Light is also emitted from certain putrefying substances.  It is usually united with heat, but it exists also independent of it.<p><DD>2.

The adverb signifies at ease, leisurely, slowly, hardly, with labor or difficulty.  I think, must have been derived from the Latin.  This word seems originally to have denoted leisure, freedom from business, a time given to sports, games or exercises, and afterwards time given to literary studies.  the sense of a crowd, collection or shoal, seems to be derivative.]<p><DD>1.

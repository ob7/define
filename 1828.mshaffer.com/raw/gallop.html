The movement or pace of a quadruped, particularly of a horse,by springs, reaches or leaps.  The animal lifts his fore feet nearly at the same time, and as these descend and are just ready to touch the ground, the hind feet are lifted at once.  The gallop is the swiftest pace of a horse, but it is also a moderate pace, at the pleasure of a rider.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

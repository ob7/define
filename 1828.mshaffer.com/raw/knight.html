The admission to this privilege was a ceremony of great importance, and was the origin of the institution of knighthood.  Hence, in feudal times, a knight was a man admitted to military rank by a certain ceremony.  This privilege was conferred on youths of family and fortune, and hence sprung the honorable title of knight, in modern usage.  A knight has the title of Sir.<p><DD>2.  A pupil or follower.<p><DD>3.

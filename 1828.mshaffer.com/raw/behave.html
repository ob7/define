To restrain; to govern; to subdue. <p><DD>  He did behave his anger e'er 'twas spent.<p>This sense is obsolete.  Yet it often seems to be implied; for to behave one's self, is really, to govern one's self; to have in command.<p><DD>2.  To carry; to conduct; used with the reciprocal pronoun; as, he behaves himself manfully.  But the tendency of modern usage is to omit the pronoun; as, he behaves well.<p><b>BEHA'VE</b>, v.i.  To act; to conduct; generally applied to manners, or to conduct in any particular business; and in a good or bad sense.  He behaves well or will.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

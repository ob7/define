In old authors, this sometimes signifies particular, very, or same. "And on tham <i>sylfan</i> geare;" in that same year, that very year. <i>Sax</i>. <i>Chron</i>. A.D. 1052, 1061.<p>                   Shoot another arrow that <i>self</i> way. <i>Shak</i>.<p>                   On these <i>self</i> hills. <i>Raleigh</i>.<p>                   At that <i>self</i> moment enters Palamon. <i>Dryden</i>.<p>           In this sense,<i> self</i> is an adjective, and is now obsolete, except when followed by <i>same</i>; as on the <i>self-same</i> day; the <i>self-same </i>hour; the <i>self-same </i>thing; which is tautology.<p>           2. In present usage, <i>self</i>is united to certain personal pronouns and pronominal adjectives, to express emphasis or distinction; also when the pronoun is used reciprocally. thus, for emphasis, I <i>myself</i> will write; I will examine for <i>myself</i>; Thou <i>thyself</i> shalt go; thou shalt see for <i>thyself</i>; You <i>yourself</i> shall write; you shall see for <i>yourself</i>. He <i>himself</i> shall write; he shall examine for <i>himself</i>. She <i>herself</i> shall write; she shall examine for <i>herself</i>. The child <i>itself </i>shall be carried; it shall be present<i> itself</i>.<p>     Reciprocally, I abhor <i>myself</i>; thou enrichest <i>thyself</i>; he loves <i>himself</i>; she admires <i>herself</i>; it pleases <i>itself</i>; we value <i>ourselves</i>; ye hurry <i>yourselves</i>; they see <i>themselves</i>. I did not hurt him, he hurt <i>himself</i>; he did not hurt me, I hurt <i>myself</i>.<p>     Except when added to pronouns used reciprocally, <i>self</i> serves to give emphasis to the pronoun, or to render the distinction expressed by it more emphatical. "I <i>myself</i> will decide," not only expresses my determination to decide, but the determination that no other shall decide.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

[L. insurgo; in and surgo, to rise.]<p><DD>1.  A rising against civil or political authority; the open and active opposition of a number of persons to the execution of a law in a city or state.  It is equivalent to sedition, except that sedition expresses a less extensive rising of citizens.  It differs from rebellion, for the latter expresses a revolt, or an attempt to overthrow the government, to establish a different one or to place the country under another jurisdiction.  It differs from mutiny, as it respects the civil or political government; whereas a mutiny is an open opposition to law in the army or navy.  Insurrection is however used with such latitude as to comprehend either sedition or rebellion.<p><DD><DD> It is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings,and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein. Ezra. 4.<p><DD>2.  A rising in mass to oppose an enemy. [Little used.]</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

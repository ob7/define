In law, the private, unlawful, felonious taking of another person's goods or movables, with an intent to steal them.  To constitute theft, the taking must be in private or without the owner's knowledge, and it must be unlawful or felonious, that is, it must be with a design to deprive the owner of his property privately and against his will.  Theft differs from robbery, as the latter is a violent taking from the person, and of course not private.<p><DD>1.  The thing stolen.

Prudent economy; good husbandry or housewifery; a sparing use or appropriation of money or commodities; a judicious use of any thing to be expended or employed; that careful management of money or goods which expends nothing unnecessarily, and applies what is used to a profitable purpose; that use in which nothing is wasted.  It is not equivalent to parsimony, the latter being an excess of frugality, and a fault.  Frugality is always a virtue.  Nor is it synonymous with thrift, in its proper sense; for thrift is the effect of frugality.<p><DD>Without frugality none can become rich, and with it few would be poor.<p><DD>2.  A prudent and sparing use or appropriation of any thing; as frugality of praise.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

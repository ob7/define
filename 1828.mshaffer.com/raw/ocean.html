The vast body of water which covers more than three fifths of the surface of the globe, called also the sea, or great sea.  It is customary to speak of the ocean as if divided into three parts, the Atlantic ocean, the Pacific ocean, and the Indian ocean; but the ocean is one mass or body, partially separated by the continents of Europe, Asia and Africa on one side, and by America on the other.<p><DD>2.  An immense expanse; as the boundless ocean of eternity; oceans of duration and space.<p><b>OCEAN,</b> a. o'shun.

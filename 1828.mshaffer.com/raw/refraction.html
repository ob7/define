The deviation of a moving body, chiefly rays of light, from a direct course.  This is occasioned by the different densities of the mediums through which light passes.<p><DD>Refraction out of a rarer medium into a denser, is made towards the perpendicular.<p><DD>Refraction may be caused by a body's falling obliquely out of one medium into another.<p><DD>Refraction double, the separation of a ray of light into two separate parts, by passing through certain transparent mediums, as the Iceland crystal.  All crystals, except those whose primitive form is either a cube or a regular octahedron, exhibit double refraction.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

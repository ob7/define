The doctrine or system of moral duties, or the duties of men in their social character; ethics.<p><DD><DD> The system of morality to be gathered from the writings of ancient sages, falls very short of that delivered in the gospel.<p><DD>1.  The practice of the moral duties; virtue.  We often admire the politeness of men whose morality we question.<p><DD>2.  The quality of an action which renders it good; the conformity of an act to the divine law, or to the principles of rectitude.  This conformity implies that the act must be performed by a free agent, and from a motive of obedience to the divine will.  This is the strict theological and scriptural sense of morality.  But we often apply the word to actions which accord with justice and human laws, without reference to the motives form which they proceed.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

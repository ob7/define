[Gr. breaking, from to break.]<p><DD>Refracting; breaking the rectilinear course of light.<p>Anaclastic glasses, sonorous glasses or phials, which are flexible, and emit a vehement noise by means of the human breath; called also vexing glasses, from the fright which their resilience occasions.  They are low phials with flat bellies, like inverted tunnels, and with very thin convex bottoms.  By drawing out a little air, the bottom springs into a concave form with a smart crack; and by breathing or blowing into them, the bottom, with a like noise, springs into its former convex form.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

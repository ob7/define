[L. ambitio, from ambio, to go about, or to seek by making interest, of amb, about, and eo, to go.  See Ambages.

It is used in a good sense; as, emulation may spring from a laudable ambition.  It denotes also an inordinate desire of power, or eminence, often accompanied with illegal means to obtain the object.  It is sometimes followed by of; as, a man has an ambition of wit.  Milton has used the word in the Latin sense of going about, or attempting; but this sense is hardly legitimate.<p><b>AMBI'TION,</b> v.t.  Ambitiously to seek after.

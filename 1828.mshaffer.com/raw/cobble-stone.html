A roundish stone; a pebble; supposed to be a fragment, rounded by the attrition of water.  We give this name to stones of various sizes, from that of a hens egg or smaller, to that of large paving stones.  These stones are called by the English copple-stones and bowlder-stones or bowlders.  The latter name is among us known only in books.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

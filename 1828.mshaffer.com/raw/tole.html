To draw or cause to follow by presenting something pleasing or desirable to view; to allure by some bait.  Thus our farmers tole sheep and make them follow, by holding to them a measure of corn or some portion of fodder.  In New England, it is applied only to the alluring of beasts.  Locke has applied it to men.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

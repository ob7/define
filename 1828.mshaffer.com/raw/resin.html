[L., Gr. to flow.]<p><DD>An inflammable substance, hard when cool, but viscid when heated, exuding in a fluid state from certain kinds of trees, as pine, either spontaneously or by incision.  Resins are soluble in oils and alcohol, and are said to be nothing but oils concreted by combination with oxygen.  Resins differ from gums, which are vegetable mucilage; and they are less sweet and odorous than balsams.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

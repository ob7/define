In natural history, a difference not permanent or invariable, but occasioned by an accidental change; as a variety of any species of plant.<p><DD>Naturalists formerly erred very much in supposing an accidental variety of plants, animals or minerals, to be a distinct species.  Ray has established a good test for varieties in botany.  A plant is distinct, which propagates itself in its own form by its seed; but when the difference disappears in the new plant, it is only a variety.  Variety then is a difference between individuals, not permanent nor important enough to constitute a distinct species; such as in size, color, fullness, curling, &c.<p><DD>7.  Different sort; as varieties of soil or land.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

A peculiar sort of onyx; also, a stone on which are found various figures and representations of landscapes, a kind of lusus naturae, exhibiting pictures without painting.  The word is said to be the oriental camehuia, a name given to the onyx, when they find, in preparing it, another color; as who should say, another color.<p><DD>The word is applied by others to those precious stones, onyxes, carnelians and agates, on which lapidaries employ their art, to aid nature and perfect the figures.<p><DD>The word is also applied to any gem on which figures may be engraved.<p><DD>The word signifies also a painting in which there is only one color, and where the lights and shadows are of gold, wrought on a golden or azure ground.  When the ground is yellow, the French call it cirage; when gray, grisaille.  This work is chiefly used to represent bassorelievos.<p><DD>Camera obscura, or dark chamber, in optics, an apparatus representing an artificial eye, in which the images of external objects, received through a double convex glass, are exhibited distinctly, and in their native colors, on a white matter, placed within the machine, in the focus of the glass.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

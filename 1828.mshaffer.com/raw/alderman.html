Aldermen.<p><DD>1.  Among our Saxon ancestors, a senior or superior.  The title was applied to princes, dukes, earls, senators and presiding magistrates; also to archbishops and bishops, implying superior wisdom or authority.  Thus, Ethelstan, duke of the East-Anglians, was called alderman of all England; and there were aldermen of cities, counties, and castles, who had jurisdiction within their respective districts.<p><DD>2.  In present usage, a magistrate or officer of a town corporate, next in rank below the mayor.  The number of aldermen is different in different cities.  In London the number is twenty-six, one in each ward, and the office is held for life.<p><DD>In the United States, the number of aldermen depends on the charters of incorporation.  In general, aldermen have the powers of a justice of the peace, and with the mayor, they constitute the court of the corporation.  In most of our cities, they are annually elected by the citizens.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

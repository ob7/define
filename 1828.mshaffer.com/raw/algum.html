In scripture, a tree or wood about which the learned are not agreed.  The most probably conjecture is that the word denotes gummy or resinous wood in general.<p><DD>The Vulgate translates it ligna thyina, and the Septuagint, wrought-wood; others, ebony, bravil or pine, and the Rabbins render it coral.  It was used for musical instruments, stair cases, &c.<p><DD>The thyinum is the citron tree, from Mauritania, much esteemed by the ancients for its fragrance and beauty.  The almug, almugim, or algumin, or simply gummin is most probably a gummy wood, and perhaps may be the Shittim, often mentioned in Scripture.  See 1Kings 10:11.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

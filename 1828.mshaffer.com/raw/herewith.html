With this.<p>Most of the compounds of here and a preposition, are obsolete or obsolescent, or at least are deemed inelegant.  But hereafter and heretofore are in elegant use.  Herein and hereby are frequently used in the present version of the Scriptures, and ought not perhaps to be discarded. Indeed some of these words seem to be almost indispensable in technical law language.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

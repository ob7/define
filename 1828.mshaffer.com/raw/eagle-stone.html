Etite, a variety of argillaceous oxyd of iron, occurring in masses varying from the size of a walnut to that of a man's head.  Their form is spherical, oval or nearly reniform, or sometimes like a parallelopiped with rounded edges and angles.  They have a rough surface, and are essentially composed of concentric layers. These nodules often embrace at the center a kernel or nucleus, sometimes movable, and always differing from the exterior in color, density and fracture.  To these hollow nodules the ancients gave the name of eagle-stones, from an opinion that the eagle transported them to her nest to facilitate the laying of her eggs.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

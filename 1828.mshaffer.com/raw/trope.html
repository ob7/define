[L. tropus; Gr. to turn.]  In rhetoric, a word or expression used in a different sense from that which it properly signifies; or a word changed from its original signification to another, for the sake of giving life or emphasis to an idea, as when we call a stupid fellow an ass, or a shrewd man a fox.<p><DD>Tropes are chiefly of four kinds, metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, and irony.  Some authors make figure the genus, of which trope is a species; others make them different things, defining trope to be a change of sense, and figure to be any ornament, except what becomes so by such change.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

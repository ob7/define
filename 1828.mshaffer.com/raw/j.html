This letter has been added to the English Alphabet in modern days;  the letter I being written formerly in words where J is now used.  It seems to have had the sound of y, in many words, as it still has in the German.  The English sound of this letter may be expressed by dzh, or edzh, a compound sound coinciding exactly with that of g, in genius; the French j, with the articulation d preceding it.  It is the tenth letter of the English Alphabet.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

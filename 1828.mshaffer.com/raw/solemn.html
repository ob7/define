The worship of this image was advanced and a solemn supplication observed every year.  [I doubt the correctness of this definition of Johnson; or whether solemn, in out language, ever includes the sense of anniversary.  In the passage cited, the sense of anniversary is expressed by every year, and if it is included in solemn also the sentence is tautological.  I should say the, that solemn in this passage of Stillingfleet, has the sense given in the second definition below.]<p><DD>2.

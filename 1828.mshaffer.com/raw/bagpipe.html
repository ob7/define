It consists of a leathern bag, which receives the air by a tube, which is stopped by a valve; and pipes, into which the air is pressed by the performer.  The base-pipe is called the drone, and the tenor or treble is called the chanter.  The pipes have eight holes like those of a flute, which the performer stops and opens at pleasure.  There are several species of bag-pipes, as the soft and melodious Irish bag-pipe, with two short drones and a long one; the Highland bag-pipe, with two short drones, the music of which is very loud; the Scot's Lowland bag-pipe, which is played with a bellows and is also a loud instrument.  There is also a small pipe, with a chanter about eight inches in length.<p>In seamanship, to bag-pipe the mizen, is to lay it aback by <DD><p>11<p>bringing the sheet to the mizen shrouds.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

In metallurgy and assaying, a docimastic hundred; a weight divisible first into a hundred parts, and then into smaller parts.  The metallurgists use a weight divided into a hundred equal parts, each one pound; the whole they call a centner; the pound is divided into thirty-two parts or half ounces; the half ounce into two quarters, and each of these into two drams.  But the assayers use different weights.  With them a centner is one dram, to which the other parts are proportioned.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

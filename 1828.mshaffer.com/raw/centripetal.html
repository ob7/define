Tending towards the center.  Centripetal force is that force which draws or impels a body towards some point as a center; as in case of a planet revolving round the sun, the center of the system. [Note: The common accentuation of centrifugal and centripetal is artificial and harsh.  The accent on the first and third syllables, as in circumpolar, would be natural and easy.]</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

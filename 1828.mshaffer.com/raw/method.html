Classification; arrangement of natural bodies according to their common characteristics; as the method of Theophrast; the method of Ray; the Linnean method.<p>In natural arrangements a distinction is sometimes made between method and system.  System is an arrangement founded, throughout all its parts, on some one principle.  Method is an arrangement less fixed and determinate, and founded on more general relations.  Thus we say, the natural method, and the artificial or sexual system of Linne, though the latter is not a perfect system.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

The corner of a fire-place, or the space between the fire and the sides of the fire-place.  In the Northern States of America, fire-places were formerly made six or eight feet wide, or even more, and a stool was placed by the side of the fire, as a seat for children, and this often furnished a comfortable situation for idlers.  As fuel has become scarce, our fire-places are contracted, till, in many or most of our dwellings, we have no chimney-corners.<p><DD>2.  In a more enlarged sense, the fire-side, or a place near the fire.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

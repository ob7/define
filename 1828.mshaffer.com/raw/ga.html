It sometimes has the force of the Latin cum or con, as in gawithan, to conjoin.  But in most words it appears to have no use,and in modern English it is entirely lost.  Y-cleped, in which ge is changed into y, is the last word in which the English retained this prefix.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

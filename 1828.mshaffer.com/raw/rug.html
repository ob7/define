[This belongs to the great family of rough, L. ruga, raucus.]<p><DD>1.  A coarse nappy woolen cloth used for a bed cover, and in modern times particularly, for covering the carpet before a fire-place.  This name was formerly given to a coarse kind of frieze used for winter garments, and it may be that the poor in some countries still wear it.  But in America, I believe the name is applied only to a bed cover for ordinary beds, and to a covering before a fire-place.<p><DD>2.

[Eng. cranny, L. crena, Gr.]<p><DD>1.  To separate any substance into parts with force or sudden violence; to tear asunder; to split; as, powder rends a rock in blasting; lightning rends an oak.<p><DD>An empire from its old foundation rent.<p><DD>I rend my tresses, and by breast I wound.<p><DD>Neither rend your clothes, lest ye die.  Lev. 10.<p><DD>2.  To separate or part with violence.<p><DD>I will surely rend the kingdom from thee.  1Kings 11.<p><DD>To rend the heart, in Scripture, to have bitter sorrow for sin.  Joel 2.<p><DD>To rend the heavens, to appear in majesty.  Is. 64.<p><DD>Rend differs somewhat from lacerate.  We never say, to lacerate a rock or a kingdom, when we mean to express splitting or division.  Lacerate is properly applicable to the tearing off of small pieces of a thing, as to lacerate the body with a whip or scourge; or to the tearing of the flesh or other thing without entire separation.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

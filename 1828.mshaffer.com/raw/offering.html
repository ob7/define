Presenting; proposing; sacrificing; bidding; presenting to the eye or mind.<p><b>OF'FERING,</b> n.  That which is presented in divine service; an animal or a portion of bread or corn, or of gold and silver, or other valuable articles, presented to God as an atonement for sin, or as a return of thanks for his favors, or for other religious purpose; a sacrifice; an oblation.  In the Mosaic economy, there were burnt-offerings, sin-offerings, peace-offerings, trespass-offerings, thank-offerings,  wave-offerings, and wood-offerings.  Pagan nations also present offerings to their deities.  Christ by the offering of himself has superseded the use of all other offerings, having made atonement for all men.<p><DD>When thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed - Is. 53.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

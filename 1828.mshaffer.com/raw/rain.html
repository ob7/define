[It seems that rain is contracted from regen.  It is the Gr. to rain, to water, which we retain in brook, and the Latins, by dropping the prefix, in rigo, irrigo, to irrigate.  The primary sense is to pour out, to drive forth.  Heb.]<p><DD>1.  To fall in drops from the clouds, as water; used mostly with it for a nominative; as, it rains; it will rain; it rained, or it has rained.<p><DD>2.  To fall or drop like rain; as, tears rained at their eyes.<p><b>RAIN,</b> v.t.  To pour or shower down from the upper regions, like rain from the clouds.<p><DD>Then said the Lord to Moses, behold I will rain bread from heaven for you.  Ex. 14.<p><DD>God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.  Job. 20.<p><DD>Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and horrible tempest.  Ps. 11.<p><b>RAIN,</b> n.  The descent of water in drops from the clouds; or the water thus falling.  Rain is distinguished from mist, by the size of the drops, which are distinctly visible.  When water falls in very small drops or particles, we call it mist, and fog is composed of particles so fine as to be not only indistinguishable, but to float or be suspended in the air.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

[Gr.]<p><DD>Abstruse; pertaining to deep learning; and opposed to exoteric.  Aristotle's lectures were of two kinds, acroatic, acroamatic, or esoteric, which were delivered to a class of select disciples, who had been previously instructed in the elements of learning; and exoteric, which were delivered in public.  The former respected being, God, and nature; the principal subjects of the latter were logic, rhetoric, and policy.  The abstruse lectures were called acroatics.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

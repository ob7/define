Under the feudal system of tenures, every vassal or tenant was bound to be true and faithful to his lord, and to defend him against all his enemies.  This obligation was called his fidelity or fealty, and an oath of fealty was required to be taken by all tenants to their landlords.  The tenant was called a liege man; the land, a liege fee; and the superior, liege lord.  [See Liege.]</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

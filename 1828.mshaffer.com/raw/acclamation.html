Anciently, acclamation was a form of words, uttered with vehemence, somewhat resembling a song, sometimes accompanied with applauses which were given by the hands.  Acclamations were ecclesiastical, military, nuptial, senatorial, synodical, theatrical, &e; They were musical and rythmical; and bestowed for joy, respect, and even reproach, and often accompanied with words, repeated, five, twenty, and even sixty and eighty times.  In the later ages of Rome, acclamations were performed by a chorus of music instructed for the purpose.<p><DD>In modern times, acclamations are expressed by huzzas; by clapping of hands; and often by repeating vivat rex, vivat respublica, long live the king or republish, or other words expressive of joy and good wishes.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

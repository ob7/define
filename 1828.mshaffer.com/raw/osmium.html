[Gr. odor.]  A metal recently discovered, and contained in the ore of platinum.  A native alloy of this metal with iridium is found in grains along the rivers in South America.  Osmium has a dark gray color; it is not volatile when heated in close vessels, but heated in the open air, it absorbs oxygen and forms a volatile oxyd.  It is insoluble in the acids, readily soluble in potassa and very volatile.  It takes its name from the singular smell of its oxyd.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

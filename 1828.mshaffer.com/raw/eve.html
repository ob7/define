The consort of Adam, and mother of the human race; so called by Adam, because she was the mother of all living.  In this case,the word would properly belong to the Hebrew.  But the Hebrew name is havah or chavah, coinciding with the verb, to shew, to discover, and Parkhurst hence denominates Eve, the manifester. In the Septuagint, Eve, in Gen.3.20, is rendered life; but in Gen.4.1,<p>it is rendered Euan or Evan.  The reason of this variation is not obvious, as the Hebrew is the same in both passages.  In Russ. Eve is Evva.  In the Chickasaw language of America, a wife is called awah, says Adair.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

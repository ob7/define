Displezhur. <p><DD>1. Some irritation or uneasiness of the mind, occasioned by any thing that counteracts desire or command, or which opposes justice and a sense of propriety. A man incurs the displeasure of another by thwarting his views or schemes; a servant incurs the displeasure of his master by neglect or disobedience; we experience displeasure at any violation of right or decorum. Displeasure is anger, but it may be slight anger. It implies disaprobation or hatred, and usually expresses less than vexation and indignation. Thus, slighter offenses give displeasure, although they may not excite a violent passion.<p><DD>2.

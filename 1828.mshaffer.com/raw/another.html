[an, or one and other.]<p><DD>1.  Not the same; different; as, we have one form of government; France, another.<p><DD>2.  One more, in addition to a former number, indefinitely; as, grant one request, they will ask another favor, another and another.<p><DD>3.  Any other; any different person, indefinitely; as, "Let another praise thee and not thy own mouth."  This word is often used without a noun, becoming a substitute for the name of the person or thing; as in the last example.  It is also much used in opposition to one, as in the first and second passages cited.  It is also frequently used with one, in a reciprocal sense; as, "love one another;" "bear one another's burdens;" that is, love one, or let one love another.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

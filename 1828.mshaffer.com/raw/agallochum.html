The first variety is light and porous, and so filled with a fragrant resin, that it may be molded by the fingers; the second is denser and less resinous; and the third is the aloes-wood used by cabinet makers and inlayers.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

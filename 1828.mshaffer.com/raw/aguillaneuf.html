[From a, to, gui, misleto, and l'an neuf, the new year.]<p><DD>A form of rejoicing among the ancient Franks, on the first day of the year; derived from the druidical custom of cutting misleto, which was held sacred by the druids, and on the first day of the year, consecrating it by crying, aguillaneuf, the year to the misleto.  This cry is said to be still observed in some parts of France; and the term came to signify also a begging of New Year's gifts.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

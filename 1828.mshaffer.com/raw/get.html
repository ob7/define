[gat, obs.] pp. got, gotten.<p><DD>1.  To procure; to obtain; to gain possession of, by almost any means.  We get favor by kindness; we get wealth by industry and economy; we get land by purchase; we get praise by good conduct; and we get blame by doing injustice.  The merchant should get a profit on his goods; the laborer should get a due reward for his labor; most men get what they can for their goods or for their services.  Get differs from acquire, as it does not always express permanence of possession, which is the appropriate sense of acquire.  We get a book or a loaf of bread by borrowing, we do not acquire it; but we get or acquire an estate.<p><DD>2.  To have.<p><DD><DD> Thou hast got the face of a man.<p><DD><DD>This is a most common, but gross abuse of this word.  We constantly hear it said, I have got no corn, I have got no money, she has got a fair complexion, when the person means only, I have no corn, I have no money, she has a fair complexion.<p><DD>3.  To beget; to procreate; to generate.<p><DD>4.  To learn; as, to get a lesson.<p><DD>5.  To prevail on; to induce; to persuade.<p><DD><DD> Though the king could not get him to engage in a life of business.  [This is not elegant.]<p><DD>6.  To procure to be.  We could not get the work done.

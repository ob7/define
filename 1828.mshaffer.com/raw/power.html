[The Latin has posse, possum, potes, potentia. The primary sense of the verb is to strain, to exert force.]<p><DD>1.  In a philosophical sense, the faculty of doing or performing any thing; the faculty of moving or of producing a change in something; ability or strength. A man raises his hand by his own power, or by power moves another body.  The exertion of power proceeds from the will, and in strictness, no being destitute of will or intelligence, can exert power.  Power in man is active or speculative.  Active power is that which moves the body; speculative power is that by which we see, judge, remember, or in general, by which we think.<p><DD>Power may exist without exertion.  We have power to speak when we are silent.<p><DD>Power has been distinguished also into active and passive,the power of doing or moving, and the power of receiving impressions or of suffering.  In strictness, passive power is an absurdity in terms.  To say that gold has a power to be melted,is improper language,yet for want of a more appropriate word, power is often used in a passive sense, and is considered as two-fold; viz.as able to make or able to receive any change.<p><DD>2.  Force; animal strength; as the power of the arm, exerted in lifting, throwing or holding.<p><DD>3.  Force; strength; energy; as the power of the mind, of the imagination, of the fancy.  He has not powers of genius adequate to the work.<p><DD>4.  Faculty of the mind, as manifested by a particular mode of operation; as the power of thinking, comparing and judging; the reasoning powers.<p><DD>5.  Ability, natural or moral.  We say, a man has the power of doing good; his property gives him the power of relieving the distressed; or he has the power to persuade others to do good; or it is not in his power to pay his debts.  The moral power of man is also his power of judging or discerning in moral subjects.<p><DD>6.  In mechanics, that which produces motion or force, or which may be applied to produce it.  Thus the inclined plane is called a mechanical power, as it produces motion, although this in reality depends on gravity.  The wheel and axle, and the lever, are mechanical powers, as they may be applied to produce force.  These powers are also called forces, and they are of two kinds, moving power, and sustaining power.<p><DD>7.  Force.  The great power of the screw is of extensive use in compression.  The power of steam is immense.<p><DD>8.  That quality in any natural body which produces a change or makes an impression on another body; as the power of medicine; the power of heat; the power of sound.<p><DD>9.  Force; strength; momentum; as the power of the wind, which propels a ship or overturns a building.<p>    10. Influence; that which may move the mind; as the power of arguments or of persuasion.<p>    11. Command; the right of governing, or actual government; dominion; rule, sway; authority. A large portion of Asia is under the power of the Russian emperor. The power of the British monarch is limited by law. The powers of government are legislative, executive, judicial, and ministerial.<p><DD><DD> Power is no blessing in itself, but when it is employed to protect the innocent.<p><DD>Under this sense may be comprehended civil, political, ecclesiastical, and military power.<p>    12. A sovereign, whether emperor, king or governing prince or the legislature of a state; as the powers of Europe; the great powers; the smaller powers. In this sense, the state or nation governed seems to be included in the word power. Great Britain is a great naval power.<p>    13. One invested with authority; a ruler; a civil magistrate. Rom.13.<p>    14. Divinity; a celestial or invisible being or agent supposed to have dominion over some part of creation; as celestial powers; the powers of darkness.<p>    15.

Legal authority; warrant; as a power of attorney; an agent invested with ample power. The envoy has full powers to negotiate a treaty.<p>    17. In arithmetic and algebra, the product arising from the multiplication of a number or quantity into itself; as, a cube is the third power; the biquadrate is the fourth power.<p>    18. In Scripture, right; privilege. John 1. 1 Cor.9.<p>    19. Angels, good or bad. Col 1. Eph. 6.<p>    20. Violence, force; compulsion. Ezek. 4.<p>    21.

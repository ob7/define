[L. <i>scutum</i>, a shield.]<p>           1. Literally, the interception, cutting of or interruption of the rays of light; hence, the obscurity which is caused by such interception. <i>Shad </i>differs from<i> shadow</i>, as it implies no particular form or definite limit. whereas a <i>shadow</i> represents in form the object which intercepts the light. Hence when we say, let us resort to the <i>shade</i> of a tree, we have no reference to its form; but when we speak of measuring a pyramid or other object by its <i>shadow</i>, we have reference to its extent.<p>           2. Darkness; obscurity; as the <i>shades</i> of night.<p>          3. An obscure place, properly in a grove or close wood, which precludes the sun's rays; an hence, a secluded retreat.<p>                   Let us seek out some desolate <i>shade</i>, and there <p>                   Weep our sad bosoms empty. <i>Shak</i>. <p>           4. A screen; something that intercepts light or heat.<p>           5. Protection; shelter. [See<i> Shadow</i>.]<p>           6. In <i>painting</i>, the dark part of the picture.<p>           7. Degree or gradation of light.<p>                   White, red, yellow, blue, with their several degrees, or <i>shades</i> and mixtures, as green, come only in by the eyes. <i>Locke</i>.<p>           8. A shadow. [See <i>Shadow</i>.]<p>                   Envy will merit, as its <i>shade</i>, pursue. <i>Pope</i>. [This is allowable in poetry.]<p>           9. The soul, after its separation from the body; so called because the ancients supposed it to be perceptible to the sight, not to the touch; a spirit; aghost; as the <i>shades</i> of departed heroes.<p>                   Swift as thought, the flitting <i>shade</i>-  <i>Dryden</i>. <p><b>SHADE</b>, v.t.  <p>           1. To shelter or screen from light by intercepting its rays; and when applied to the rays of the sun, it segnifies to shelter from light and heat; as, a large tree <i>shades</i> the plants under its branches; <i>shaded</i> vegetables rarely come to perfection. <DD><p>                   I went to the sylvan scenes,<p>                   And <i>shade</i> our altars with their leafy greens. <i>Dryden.</i></SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

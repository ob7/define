The act of adjourning; as, in legislatures, the adjournment of one house is not an adjournment of the other.<p><DD>2.  The putting off till another day or time specified, or without day; that is, the closing of a session of a public or official body.<p><DD>3.  The time or interval during which a public body defers business; as, during an adjournment.  but a suspension of business, between the forming of a house and an adjournment for refreshment, is all a recess.  In Great Britain, the close of a session of parliament is called a prorogation; as the close of a parliament is a dissolution.  But in Great Britain, as well as in the United States, adjournment is now used for an intermission of business, for any indefinite time; as, an adjournment of parliament for six weeks.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

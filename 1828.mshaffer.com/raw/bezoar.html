An antidote; a general name for certain animal substances supposed to be efficacious in preventing the fatal effects of poison.  Bezoar is a calcarious concretion found in the stomach of certain ruminant animals, composed of concentric coats surrounding each other, with a little cavity in the middle, containing a bit of wood, straw, hair, or the like substance.  There are two sorts; the oriental, from Persia and the East Indies, of a shining dark green or olive color, with a smooth surface; and the occidental, from the Spanish West Indies, which has a rough surface, is less green much heavier, more brittle, and of a looser texture.  The oriental is generally less than a walnut;the occidental is larger, and sometimes as large as a goose egg.<p><DD>      The oriental bezoars are generally of a resinous composition and combustible.<p><DD>2.  In a more general sense, any substance formed, stratum upon stratum, in the stomach or intestines of animals.<p><DD><DD>This name is also given to the biliary calculi of certain animals.<p>Fossil-bezoar is a figured stone, formed, like the animal bezoar, with several coats round some extraneous body, which serves as a nucleus; found chiefly in Sicily, in sand and clay pits.  It is of a purple color, and of the size of a walnut.  It seems to be of the nature of bole armenian, and is called Sicilian earth.<p>Bezoar-mineral.  This preparation is an oxyd of antimony, produced by distilling the nitrous acid several times to dryness from the sublimated muriate of antimony.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

[Gr. a limb, or a song, an ode; L. melos.]<p>An agreeable succession of sounds; a succession of sounds so regulated and modulated as to please the ear.  To constitute melody, the sounds must be arranged according to the laws of rhythms, measure, or the due proportion of the movements to each other.  Melody differs from harmony, as it consists in the agreeable succession and modulation of sounds by a single voice; whereas harmony consists in the accordance of different voices or sounds.  Melody is vocal or instrumental.<p>To make melody in the heart, to praise God with a joyful and thankful disposition, ascribing to him the honor due to his name. Eph.5.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

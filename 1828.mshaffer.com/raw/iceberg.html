[ice and a hill.]  A hill or mountain of ice, or a vast body of ice accumulated in valleys in high northern latitudes.<p>This term is applied to such elevated masses as exist in the valleys of the frigid zones; to those which are found on the surface of fixed ice; and to ice of great thickness and highth in a floating state.  These lofty floating masses are sometimes detached from the icebergs on shore, and sometimes formed at a distance from any land.

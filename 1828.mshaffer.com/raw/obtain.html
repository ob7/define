[L. obtineo; ob and teneo, to hold.]<p><DD>1.  To get; to gain; to procure; in a general sense, to gain possession of a thing, whether temporary or permanent; to acquiare.  this word usually implies exertion to get possession, and in this it differs from receive, which may or may not imply exertion.  it differs from acquire, as genus from species; acquire being properly applied only to things permanently possessed; but obtain is applied both to things of temporary and of permanent possession.  We obtain loans of money on application; we obtain answers to letters; we obtain spirit from liquors by distillation and salts by evaporation.  We obtain by seeking; we often receive without seeking.  We acquire or obtain a good title to lands by deed, or by a judgment of court; but we do not acquire spirit by distillation; nor do we acquire an answer to a letter or an application.<p><DD>He shall obtain the kingdom by flatteries.

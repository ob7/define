Rapidity in motion; swiftness; speed; applied most generally to bodies moving on or near the earth; as the celerity of horse or of a fowl.  We speak of the velocity of sound or of light, or of a planet in its orbit.  This distinction however is not general, nor can the different uses of the two words be precisely defined.  We apply celerity rather than velocity to thought; but there seems to be no reason, except usage, why the two words should not be synonymous.<p><DD>2.  An affection of motion by which a movable body runs through a given space in a given time.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

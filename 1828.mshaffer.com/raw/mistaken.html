In the use of this participle, there is a peculiarity which ought to be carefully noticed. When used of persons, it signified to be in an error, to be wrong; as, I am mistaken, you are mistaken, he is mistaken.  But when used of things, it signified misunderstood, misconceived; as, the sense of the passage is mistaken, that is, not rightly understood.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

[L. supra.]  In natural history, an insect in that state in which it resembles an infant in swaddling clothes.  As some insects in this state have a bright exterior,as if gilded, it has been called chrysalis or aurelia, from the Gr. and L. aurum, gold; but as this gilded appearance belongs to few insects, the term pupa is now more generally used.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

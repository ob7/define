The first proposition is evident; but the second may require further proof, as that God received full satisfaction for sin, by the suffering of Christ.<p><DD>2.  In mathematics, a progress or passage from one proposition to another, when the first, having been demonstrated, is employed in proving others.<p><DD>3.

Quicksilver, a metal remarkable for its fusibility, which is so great that to fix or congeal it requires a degree of cold which is marked on Fahrenheit's scale at thirty nine degrees below zero.  Its specific gravity is greater than that of any other metal, except platina, gold and tungsten.  Under a heat of 660 degrees, it rises in fumes and is gradually converted into a red oxyd.  Mercury is used in barometers to ascertain the weight of the atmosphere, and in thermometers to determine the temperature of the air, for which purposes it is well adapted by its expansibility, and the extensive range between its freezing and boiling points.  Preparations of this metal are among the most powerful poisons, and are extensively used as medicines.  The preparation called calomel, is a most  efficacious deobstruent.<p><DD>2.

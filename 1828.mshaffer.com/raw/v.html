It is not a close articulation, but one that admits of some sound.  It is nearly allied to F, being formed by the same organs; but V is vocal, and F is aspirate, and this constitutes the principal difference between them.  V and U were formerly the same letter, derived no doubt from the oriental vau or waw, but they have now as distinct uses as any two letters in the alphabet, and are therefore to be considered as different letters.  V has one sound only, as in ver, vote, lavish.<p><DD>As a numeral, V stand for 5.  With a dash over it, in old books, it stands for 5000.<p><DD>V.R. among the Romans, stood for uti rogas, as you desire; V.C. for vir consularis; V.G. for verbi gratia; V.L. for videlicet.<p><DD>In music for instruments, V. stands for violin; V.V. for violins.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

A tract of low land.  In America, the word is applied particularly to the low ground on the banks of rivers, consisting of a rich mold or an alluvial soil, whether grass land, pasture, tillage or wood land; as the meadows on the banks of the Connecticut.  The word with us does not necessarily imply wet land.  This species of land is called, in the western states, bottoms, or bottom land.  The word is also used for other low or flat lands, particularly lands appropriated to the culture of grass.<p><DD>The word is said to be applied in Great Britain to land somewhat watery, but covered with grass.<p><DD>Meadow means pasture or grass land, annually mown for hay; but more particularly, land too moist for cattle to graze on in winter, without spoiling the sward.<p>[Mead is used chiefly in poetry.]</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

It is of three kinds, the white, the yellow, and the red.  The tree which produces the two former is of the genus Santalum.  It grows to the size of a walnut tree.  Its wood has a bitter taste and an aromatic smell.  The oriental nations burn it in their houses for the sake of its fragrant odor, and with the powder of it a paste is prepared, with which they anoint their bodies.  The white and the yellow sandal-wood are different parts of the same tree; the white is the wood next to the bark; the yellow is the inner part of the tree.  The red sandal-wood is obtained from a different tree, the Pierocarpus santolinus.  It is of a dull red color, has little taste or smell, and is principally used as a coloring drug.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

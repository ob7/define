[L.]  The red oxyd of lead, produced by calcination.  Lead exposed to air while melting is covered with a gray dusky pellicle.  This taken off and agitated becomes a greenish gray powder, inclining to yellow.  This oxyd, separated by sifting from the grains of lead which it contains, and exposed to a more intense heat, takes a deep yellow color, and in this state it is called massicot.  The latter, slowly heated, takes a beautiful red color, and is called minium.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

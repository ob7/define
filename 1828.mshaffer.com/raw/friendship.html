An attachment to a person, proceeding from intimate acquaintance, and a reciprocation of kind offices, or from a favorable opinion of the amiable and respectable qualities of his mind.  Friendship differs from benevolence, which is good will to mankind in general, and from that love which springs from animal appetite.  True friendship is a noble and virtuous attachment, springing from a pure source, a respect for worth or amiable qualities.  False friendship may subsist between bad men, as between thieves and pirates.  This is a temporary attachment springing from interest, and may change in a moment to enmity and rancor.<p><DD>There can be no friendship without confidence, and no confidence without integrity.<p><DD>There is little friendship in the world.<p><DD>The first law of friendship is sincerity.<p><DD>2.  Mutual attachment; intimacy.<p><DD>If not in friendship, live at least in peace.<p><DD>3.

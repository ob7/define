Every slave is a servant, but every servant is not a slave.<p>  Servants are of various kinds; as <i>household</i> or <i>domestic servants</i>, menial servants; <i>laborers</i>, who are hired by the day, week or other term, and do not reside with their employers, ot if they board in the same house, are employed abroad and not in the domestic services; <i>apprentices</i>, who are bound for a term of years to serve a master, for the purpose of learning his trade or occupation.<p>  In a <i>legal sense</i>, stewards, factors, bailifs and other agents, are <i>servants</i> for the time they are employed in such character, as they act in subordination to others.<p>           2.

[L. animadversio.]<p><DD>Remarks by way of censure or criticism; reproof; blame.  It may sometimes be used for punishment, or punishment may be implied in the word, but this is not common.  In an ecclesiastical sense, it differs from censure, says Ayliffe; censure, respecting spiritual punishment, and animadversion, a temporal one.  Glanville uses the word in the sense of perception, but this use is not authorized.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

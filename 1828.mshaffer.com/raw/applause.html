There were three species of applause, the bombus, a confused din made by the hands or mouth; the imbrices and testae, made by beating a sort of sounding vessels in the theaters.  Persons were appointed for the purpose of applauding, and masters were employed to teach the art.  The applauds were divided into choruses, and placed opposite to each other, like the choristers in a cathedral.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

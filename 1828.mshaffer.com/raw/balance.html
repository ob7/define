Figuratively, an impartial state of the mind, in deliberating; or a just estimate of the reasons and arguments on<p>both sides of a question, which gives to each its due weight, or<p>15<p>force and importance.<p><DD>4.  As balance signifies equal weight, or equality, it is by custom used for the weight or sum necessary to make two unequal weights or sums equal; that which is necessary to bring them to a balance or equipoise.  Hence, in accounts, balance is the difference of two sums; as upon an adjustment of accounts, a balance was found against A, in favor of B.  Hence, to pay a balance, is to pay the difference and make the two accounts equal.<p><DD>5.  Balance of trade is an equal exportation of domestic productions, and importation of foreign.

To adjust the weights in the scales of a balance so as to bring them to an equipoise.  Hence,<p><DD> 2.  To weigh reasons; to compare, by estimating the relative force, importance, or value of different things; as, to balance good and evil.<p><DD>3.  To regulate different powers, so as to keep them in a state of just proportion; as, to balance Europe, or the powers of Europe.<p><DD>4.

Or with what comparison shall we compare it?  Mark 4.<p><DD>6.  In rhetoric, a figure by which two things are considered with regard to a third, which is common to them both; as, a hero is like a lion in courage.  Here courage is common to hero and lion, and constitutes the point of resemblance.<p><DD><DD>The distinction between similitude and comparison is, that the former has reference to the quality; the latter, to the quantity.  Comparison is between more and less; similitude is between good and gad.  Hannibal--hung like a tempest on the declivities of the Alps--is a likeness by similitude.

[Gr. a horse, and a river.]  The river-horse, an animal that inhabits the Nile and other rivers in Africa.  This animal resembles a hog rather than a horse, and was named perhaps from his neighing voice.  He has been found of the length of 17 feet.  He delights in the water, but feeds on herbage on land.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

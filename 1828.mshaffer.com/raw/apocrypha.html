[Gr. from, to conceal.]<p><DD>Literally such things as are not published; but in an appropriate sense, books whose authors are not known; whose authenticity, as inspired writings, is not admitted, and which are therefore not considered a part of the sacred canon of the scripture.  When the Jews published their sacred books, they called them canonical and divine; such as they did not publish, were called apocryphal.  The apocryphal books are received by the Romish Church as canonical, but not by Protestants.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

Having analogy; used by way of analogy; bearing some relation.  Thus analogical reasoning is reasoning from some similitude which things known bear to things unknown.  An analogical word is one which carries with it some relation to the original idea.  Thus the word firm primarily denotes solidity or compactness in a material body; and by analogy, when used of the mind, it conveys the idea of qualities having a similitude to the solidity of bodies, that is, fixedness or immovability.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

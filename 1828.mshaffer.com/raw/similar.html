[L.  similis; Gr.  omaloV.]  Like; resembling; having a like form or appearance.  Similar may signify exactly alike, or having a general likeness, a likeness in the principal points.  Things perfectly similar, in their nature, must be of the same essence, or homogeneous; but we generally understand similar to denote a likeness that is not perfect.  Many of the statutes of Connecticut are similar to the statutes of Massachusetts on the same subjects.  The manners of the several states of New England are similar, the people being derived from common ancestors.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

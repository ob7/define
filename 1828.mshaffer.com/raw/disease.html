[dis and ease.]<p><DD>1. In its primary sense, pain, uneasiness, distress, and so used by Spenser; but in this sense, obsolete.<p><DD>2. The cause of pain or uneasiness; distemper; malady; sickness; disorder; any state of a living body in which the natural functions of the organs are interrupted or disturbed, either by defective or preternatural action, without a disrupture of parts by violence, which is called a wound. The first effect of disease is uneasiness or pain, and the ultimate effect is death. A disease may affect the whole body, or a particular limb or part of the body. We say a diseased limb; a disease in the head or stomach; and such partial affection of the body is called a local or topical disease. The word is also applied to the disorders of other animals, as well as to those of man; and to any derangement of the vegetative functions of plants.<p><DD><DD>The shafts of disease shoot across our path in such a variety of courses, that the atmosphere of human life is darkened by their number, and the escape of an individual becomes almost miraculous.<p><DD>3. A disordered state of the mind or intellect, by which the reason is impaired.<p><DD>4. In society, vice; corrupt state of morals. Vices are called moral diseases.<p><DD><DD>A wise man converses with the wicked, as a physician with the sick, not to catch the disease, but to cure it.<p><DD>5. Political or civil disorder, or vices in a state; any practice which tends to disturb the peace of society, or impede or prevent the regular administration of government.<p><DD><DD>The instability, injustice and confusion introduced into the public councils have, in truth, been the mortal diseases under which popular governments have every where perished.<p><b>DISEASE</b>, v.t. dizeze.<p><DD>1. To interrupt or impair any or all the natural and regular functions of the several organs of a living body; to afflict with pain or sickness to make morbid; used chiefly in the passive participle, as a diseased body, a diseased stomach; but diseased may here be considered as an adjective.<p><DD>2. To interrupt or render imperfect the regular functions of the brain, or of the intellect; to disorder; to derange.<p><DD>3. To infect; to communicate disease to, by contagion.<p><DD>4. To pain; to make uneasy.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

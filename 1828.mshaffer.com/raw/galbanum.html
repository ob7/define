[Heb.varied in orthography, from to milk.]<p>The concrete gummy resinous juice of an umbelliferous plant, called Ferula Africana, &c., and by Linne, Bubon galbanum, which grows in Syria, the East Indies and Ethiopia.  This gum comes in pale-colored, semitransparent, soft, tenacious masses,of different shades, from white to brown.  It is rather resinous than gummy, and has a strong unpleasant smell, with a bitterish warm taste.  It is unctuous to the touch, and softens between the fingers.  When distilled with water or spirit, it yields an essential oil,and by distillation in a retort without mixture, it yields an empyreumatic oil of a fine blue color,but this is changed in the air to a purple.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

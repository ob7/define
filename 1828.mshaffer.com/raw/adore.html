In Heb. to honor, reverence or glorify to adorn; to be magnificent or glorious, to magnify, to glorify.  This word is usually referred to the Latin ad orare, to carry to one's mouth; ad and os, oris; as, in order to kiss one's hand, the hand is carried to one's mouth.  See Calmet, ad verbum, who cites, in confirmation of this opinion, the ancient practice of kissing the hand.  See Job 31.  1Kings, 19.  Ps. 2.  Gen 41.  Ainsworth supposes the word to be a compound of ad and oro, to pray; and if the word is compound, as I suspect, this opinion is most probably correct.]<p><DD>1.  To worship with profound reverence; to address with exalted thoughts, by prayer and thanksgiving; to pay divine honors to; to honor as a god or as divine.<p><DD>2.  To love in the highest degree; to regard with the utmost esteem, affection and respect; as, the people adore their prince.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

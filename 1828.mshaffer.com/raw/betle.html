A species of pepper, the leaves of which are chewed by the inhabitants of the East Indies.  It is a creeping or climbing plant like the ivy, the leaves somewhat resembling those of the citron.  It is planted by a tree, or supported by props.  In India, betel is taken after meals; during a visit, it is offered to friends when they meet, and when they separate; in short, nothing is to be done without betel.  To correct the bitterness of the leaves, a little areca is wrapped in them with the chinam, a kind of burnt lime made of shells.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

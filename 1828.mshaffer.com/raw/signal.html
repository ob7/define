[L.  signum.]  A sign that gives or is intended to give notice; or the notice given.  Signals are used to communicate notice, information, orders and the like, to persons at a distance, and by any persons and for the purpose.  A signal may be a motion of the hand, the raising of a flag, the firing of a gun, or any thing which, being understood by persons at a distance, may communicate notice.<p><DD>Signals are particularly useful in the navigation of fleets and in naval engagements.  There are day-signals, which are usually made by the sails, by flags and pendants, or guns; night-signals, which are lanterns disposed in certain figures, or false fires, rockets, or the firing of guns; fog-signals, which are made by sounds, as firing of guns, beating of drums, ringing of bells, &c.  There are signals of evolution, addressed to a whole fleet, to a division or to a squadron; signals of movements to particular ships; and signals of service, general or particular.  Signals used in an army are mostly made by a particular beat of the drum, or by the bugle.<p><b>SIG'NAL,</b> a.  Eminent; remarkable; memorable; distinguished from what is ordinary; as a signal exploit; a signal service; a signal ace of benevolence.  It is generally but not always used in a good sense.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

In grammar, the inflection of nouns, or a change of termination, to express a difference of relation in the word to others, or to the thing represented.  The variation of nouns and adjectives is called declension; both case and declension signifying, falling or leaning from the first state of the word.  Thus, liber is a book; libri, of a book; libro, to a book.  In other words, case denotes a variation in the termination of a noun, to show how the noun acts upon the verb with which it is connected, or is acted upon by it, or by an agent.

[Gr. resembling a deer.]<p><DD>In zoology, the gazelle; a genus of ruminant quadrupeds, intermediate between the deer and goat.  Their horns are solid and permanent straight or curved; in some species annulated; in others, surrounded by a spiral; and in others, smooth.  They resemble the deer in the lightness and elegance of their forms, and in their agility.  They inhabit open plains or mountains and some species in herds of two or three thousand.  Their eyes are large, black, and of exquisite beauty and vivacity; and are therefore a favorite image with the eastern poets.</SPAN></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><HR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR ><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR >

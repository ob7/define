[1]retaliate

   RETAL'IATE, v.t. [Low L. retalio; re and talio, from talis, like.]

   To return like for like; to repay or requite by an act of the same kind
   as has been received. It is now seldom used except in a bad sense, that
   is, to return evil for evil; as, to retaliate injuries. In war, enemies
   often retaliate the death or inhuman treatment of prisoners, the
   burning of towns or the plunder of goods.

   It is unlucky to be obliged to retaliate the injuries of authors, whose
   works are so soon forgotten that we are in danger of appearing the
   first aggressors.

     RETAL'IATE, v.i. To return like for like; as, to retaliate upon an
                                   enemy.

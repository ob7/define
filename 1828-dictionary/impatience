[1]impatience

   IMPA'TIENCE, n. [L. impatientia, from impatiens; in and patior, to
   suffer.] Uneasiness under pain or suffering; the not enduring pain with
   composure; restlessness occasioned by suffering positive evil, or the
   absence of expected good. Impatience is not rage, nor absolute
   inability to bear pain; but it implies want of fortitude, or of its
   exercise. It usually springs from irritability of temper.

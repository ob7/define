   FOREIGN, a. for'an. [L. foris, foras.]

   1. Belonging to another nation or country; alien; not of the country in
   which one resides; extraneous. We call every country foreign, which is
   not within the jurisdiction of our own government. In this sense,
   Scotland before the union was foreign to England, and Canada is now
   foreign to the United States. More generally foreign is applied to
   countries more remote than an adjacent territory; as a foreign market;
   a foreign prince. In the United States, all transatlantic countries are
   foreign.

   2. Produced in a distant country or jurisdiction; coming from another
   country; as foreign goods; goods of foreign manufacture; a foreign
   minister.

   3. Remote; not belonging; not connected; with to or from. You
   dissemble; the sentiments you express are foreign to your heart. This
   design is foreign from my thoughts. [The use of from is preferable and
   best authorized.]

   4. Impertinent; not pertaining; not to the purpose. The observation is
   foreign from the subject under consideration.

   5. Excluded; not admitted; held at a distance.

   6. Extraneous; adventitious; not native or natural.

   7. In law, a foreign attachment is an attachment of the goods of a
   foreigner within a city or liberty, for the satisfaction of a debt due
   from the foreigner to a citizen; or an attachment of the money or goods
   of a debtor, in the hands of another person.

   A foreign bill of exchange, is a bill drawn by a person in one country,
   on his correspondent or agent in another, as distinguished from an
   inland bill, which is drawn by one person or another in the same
   jurisdiction or country.

   Foreign plea, a plea or objection to a judge as incompetent to try the
   question, on the ground that it is not within his jurisdiction.

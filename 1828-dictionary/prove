   PROVE, v.t. prov. [L. probo.]

   1. To try; to ascertain some unknown quality or truth by an experiment,
   or by a test or standard. Thus we prove the strength of gunpowder by
   experiment; we prove the strength or solidity of cannon by experiment.
   We prove the contents of a vessel by comparing it with a standard
   measure.

   2. To evince, establish or ascertain as truth, reality or fact, by
   testimony or other evidence. The plaintiff in a suit, must prove the
   truth of his declaration; the prosecutor must prove his charges against
   the accused.

   3. To evince truth by argument, induction or reasoning; to deduce
   certain conclusions from propositions that are true or admitted. If it
   is admitted that every immoral act is dishonorable to a rational being,
   and that dueling is an immoral act; then it is proved by necessary
   inference, that dueling is dishonorable to a rational being.

   4. To ascertain the genuineness or validity of; to verify; as, to prove
   a will.

   5. To experience; to try by suffering or encountering; to gain certain
   knowledge by the operation of something on ourselves, or by some act of
   our own.

   Let him in arms the power of Turnus prove.

   6. In arithmetic, to show, evince or ascertain the correctness of any
   operation or result. Thus in subtraction, if the difference between two
   numbers, added to the lesser number, makes a sum equal to the greater,
   the correctness of the subtraction is proved. In other words, if the
   sum of the remainder and of the subtrahend, is equal to the minuend,
   the operation of subtraction is proved to be correct.

   7. To try; to examine.

   Prove your own selves. 2 Cor. 13.

   8. Men prove God, when by their provocations they put his patience to
   trial, Ps.95.; or when by obedience they make trial how much he will
   countenance such conduct, Mal.3.

                    PROVE, v.i. To make trial; to essay.

   report proves to be true, or proves to be false.

   3. To be found true or correct by the result.

   4. To make certain; to show; to evince.

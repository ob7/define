   MIND, n. [L. reminiscor; L. mens; Gr. memory, mention, to remember,
   mind, ardor of mind, vehemence; anger. Mind signifies properly
   intention, a reaching or inclining forward to an object, from the
   primary sense of extending, stretching or inclining, or advancing
   eagerly, pushing or setting forward, whence the Greek sense of the
   word, in analogy with the Teutonic mod, moed, muth, mind, courage,
   spirit, mettle. So L. animus, animosus.]

   1. Intention; purpose; design.

   The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination; how much more, when he
   bringeth it with a wicked mind. Prov.21.

   2. Inclination; will; desire; a sense much used, but expressing less
   than settled purpose; as in the common phrases, "I wish to know your
   mind;" "let me know your mind;" "he had a mind to go;" "he has a
   partner to his mind."

   3. Opinion; as, to express one's mind. We are of one mind.

   4. Memory; remembrance; as, to put one in mind; to call to mind; the

   intellect in man,this word came to signify.

   5. The intellectual or intelligent power in man; the understanding; the
   power that conceives, judges or reasons.

   So we speak of a sound mind, a disordered mind, a weak mind, a strong
   mind, with reference to the active powers of the understanding; and in
   a passive sense, it denotes capacity, as when we say, the mind cannot
   comprehend a subject.

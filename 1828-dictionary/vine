   VINE, n. [L. vinca. See Wine.]

   1. A plant that produces grapes, of the genus Vitis, and of a great
   number of varieties.

   2. The long slender stem of any plant, that trails on the ground, or
   climbs and supports itself by winding round a fixed object, or by
   seizing any fixed thing with its tendrils or claspers. Thus we speak of
   the hop vine, the bean vine, the vines of melons, squashes, pumpkins,
   and other encurbitaceous plants.

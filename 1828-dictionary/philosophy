   PHILOS'OPHY, n. [L. philosophia; Gr. love, to love, and wisdom.]

   1. Literally, the love of wisdom. But in modern acceptation, philosophy
   is a general term denoting an explanation of the reasons of things; or
   an investigation of the causes of all phenomena both of mind and of
   matter. When applied to any particular department of knowledge, it
   denotes the collection of general laws or principles under which all
   the subordinate phenomena or facts relating to that subject, are
   comprehended. Thus, that branch of philosophy which treats of God, &c.
   is called theology; that which treats of nature, is called physics or
   natural philosophy; that which treats of man is called logic and
   ethics, or moral philosophy; that which treats of the mind is called
   intellectual or mental philosophy, or metaphysics.

   The objects of philosophy are to ascertain facts or truth, and the
   causes of things or their phenomena; to enlarge our views of God and
   his works, and to render our knowledge of both practically useful and
   subservient to human happiness.

   True religion and true philosophy must ultimately arrive at the same
   principle.

   2. Hypothesis or system on which natural effects are explained.

   We shall in vain interpret their words by the notions of our philosophy
   and the doctrines in our schools.

   3. Reasoning; argumentation.

   4. Course of sciences read in the schools.

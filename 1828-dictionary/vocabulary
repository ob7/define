   VOCAB'ULARY, n. [L. vocabulum, a word.]

   A list or collection of the words of a language, arranged in
   alphabetical order and explained; a dictionary_webster1828 or lexicon.
   We often use vocabulary in a sense somewhat different from that of
   dictionary_webster1828, restricting the signification to the list of
   words; as when we say, the vocabulary of Johnson is more full or
   extensive than that of Entick. We rarely use the word as synonymous
   with dictionary_webster1828, but in the other countries the
   corresponding word is used and this may be so used in English.

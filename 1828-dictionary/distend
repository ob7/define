[1]distend

   DISTEND, v.t. [L., to tend, to stretch; to hold. Gr., to stretch.]

   1. To stretch or spread in all directions; to dilate; to enlarge; to
   expand; to swell; as, to distend a bladder; to distend the bowels to
   distend the lungs. [This is the appropriate sense of the word.]

   2. To spread apart; to divaricate; as, to distend the legs. We seldom
   say, to distend a plate of metal, and never, I believe, to distend a
   line; extend being used in both cases. We use distend chiefly to denote
   the stretching, spreading or expansion of any thing, by means of a
   substance inclosed within it, or by the elastic force of something
   inclosed. In this case the body distended swells or spreads in all
   directions, and usually in a spherical form. A bladder is distended by
   inflation, or by the expansion of rarefied air within it. The skin is
   distended in boils and abscesses, by matter generated within them. This
   appropriation of the word has not always been observed.

   BE'HEMOTH, n.]Heb. a beast or brute; from an Arabic vert, which
   signifies, to shut, to lie hid, to be dumb. In Eth.dumb.]

   Authors are divided in opinion as to the animal intended in scripture
   by this anme; some supposing it to be an ox, others, an elephant; and
   Bochart labors to prove it the hippopotamus, or river horse. The latter
   opinion is most probably. [See Hippopotamus.] The original word in
   Arabic signifies a brute of beast in general, especially a quadruped.

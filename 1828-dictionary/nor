   NOR, connective. [ne and or.]

   1. A word that denies ro renders negative the second or subsequent part
   of a proposition, or a proposition following another negative
   proposition; correlative to neither or not.

   2. Nor sometimes begins a sentence, but in this case a negative
   proposition has preceded it in the foregoing sentence.

   3. In some cases, usually in poetry, neither is omitted, and the
   negation which it would express is included in nor.

   Simois nor Xanthus shall be wanting there. That is, neither Simois nor
   Xanthus.

   4. Sometimes in poetry, nor is used for neither, in the first part of
   the proposition.

   I whom nor avarice nor pleasures move.

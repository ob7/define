   CORRESPOND, v.i. [L., to answer, to promise. See Sponsor.]

   1. To suit; to answer; to agree; to fit; to be congruous; to be adapted
   to. Levity of manners does not correspond with the dignity of the
   clerical character. The length of a room should correspond with the
   breadth. Actions should correspond with words.

   2. To be equal; to be adequate or proportioned. Let the means of
   prosecuting a war correspond with the magnitude of the contest.

   3. To communicate by letters sent and received; to hold intercourse
   with a person at a distance by sending and receiving letters. We
   delight to correspond with those we love and respect.

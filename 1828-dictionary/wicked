[1]wicked

   WICKED, a. [The primary sense is to wind and turn, or to depart, to
   fall away.]

   1. Evil in principle or practice; deviating from the divine law;
   addicted to vice; sinful; immoral. This is a word of comprehensive
   signification, extending to every thing that is contrary to the moral
   law, and both to persons and actions. We say, a wicked man, a wicked
   deed, wicked ways, wicked lives, a wicked heart, wicked designs, wicked
   works.

   No man was ever wicked without secret discontent.

   2. A word of slight blame; as the wicked urchin.

   3. Cursed; baneful; pernicious; as wicked words, words pernicious in
   their efforts.

   [This last signification may throw some light on the word witch.]

   The wicked, in Scripture, persons who live in sin; transgressors of the
   divine law; all who are unreconciled to God, unsanctified or
   impenitent.

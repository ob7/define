   FACT, n. [L. factum, from facio, to make or do.]

   1. Any thing done, or that comes to pass; an act; a deed; an effect
   produced or achieved; an event. Witnesses are introduced into court to
   prove a fact. Facts are stubborn things. To deny a fact knowingly is to
   lie.

   2. Reality; truth; as, in fact. So we say, indeed.

[1]earl

   EARL, n. erl.

   A British title of nobility, or a nobleman, the third in rank, being
   next below a marquis, and next above a viscount. The title answers to
   count [compte] in France, and graaf in Germany. The earl formerly had
   the government of a shire, and was called shireman. After the conquest
   earls were called counts, and from them shires have taken the name of
   counties. Earl is now a mere title, unconnected with territorial
   jurisdiction.

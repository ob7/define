   COUNTY, n. [L. See Count.]

   1. Originally, an earldom; the district or territory of a count or
   earl. Now, a circuit or particular portion of a state or kingdom,
   separated from the rest of the territory, for certain purposes in the
   administration of justice. It is called also a shire. [See Shire.] Each
   county has its sheriff and its court, with other officers employed in
   the administration of justice and the execution of the laws. In England
   there are fifty two counties, and in each is a Lord Lieutenant, who has
   command of the militia. The several states of America are divided by
   law into counties, in each of which is a county court of inferior
   jurisdiction; and in each, the supreme court of the state holds stated
   sessions.

   2. A count; an earl or lord.

   County court, the court whose jurisdiction is limited to a county,
   whose powers, in America, depend on statutes. In England, it is
   incident to the jurisdiction of the sheriff.

   County palatine, in England, is a county distinguished by particular
   privileges; so called a palatio, the palace, because the owner had
   originally royal powers, or the same powers in the administration of
   justice, as the king had in his palace; but their powers are not
   abridged. The counties palatine, in England, are Lancaster, Chester and
   Durham.

   County corporate, is a county invested with particular privileges by
   charter or royal grant; as London, York, Bristol, &c.

             COUNTY, a. Pertaining to a county; as county court.

   PRIN'CIPAL, a. [L. principalis, from princeps.]

   1. Chief; highest in rank, character or respectability; as the
   principal officers of a government; the principal men of a city, town,
   or state. Acts 25. 1 Chron.24.

   2. Chief; most important or considerable; as the principal topics of
   debate; the principal arguments in a case; the principal points of law;
   the principal beams of a building; the principal productions of a
   country.

   Wisdom is the principal thing. Prov.4.

   3. In law, a principal challenge, is where the cause assigned carries
   with it prima facie evidence of partiality, favor or malice.

   4. In music, fundamental.

       PRIN'CIPAL, n. A chief or head; one who takes the lead; as the
             principal of a faction, an insurrection or mutiny.

   1. The president, governor, or chief in authority. We apply the word to
   the chief instructor of an academy or seminary of learning.

   2. In law, the actor or absolute perpetrator of a crime, or an abettor.
   A principal in the first degree, is the absolute perpetrator of the
   crime; a principal in the second degree, is one who is present, aiding
   and abetting the fact to be done; distinguished from an accessory. In
   treason, all persons concerned are principals.

   3. In commerce, a capital sum lent on interest, due as a debt or used
   as a fund; so called in distinction from interest or profits.

   Taxes must be continued, because we have no other means for paying off
   the principal.

   4. One primarily engaged; a chief party; in distinction from an
   auxiliary.

   We were not principals, but auxiliaries in the war.

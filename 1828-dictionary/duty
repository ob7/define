   DUTY, n.

   1. That which a person owes to another; that which a person is bound,
   by any natural, moral or legal obligation, to pay, do or perform.
   Obedience to princes, magistrates and the laws is the duty of every
   citizen and subject; obedience, respect and kindness to parents are
   duties of children; fidelity to friends is a duty; reverence, obedience
   and prayer to God are indispensable duties; the government and
   religious instruction of children are duties of parents which they
   cannot neglect without guilt.

   2. Forbearance of that which is forbid by morality, law, justice or
   propriety. It is our duty to refrain from lewdness, intemperance,
   profaneness and injustice.

   3. Obedience; submission.

   4. Act of reverence or respect.

   They both did duty to their lady.

   5. The business of a soldier or marine on guard; as, the company is on
   duty. It is applied also to other services or labor.

   6. The business of war; military service; as, the regiment did duty in
   Flanders.

   7. Tax, toll, impost, or customs; excise; any sum of money required by
   government to be paid on the importation, exportation, or consumption
   of goods. An impost on land or other real estate, and on the stock of
   farmers, is not called a duty, but a direct tax.

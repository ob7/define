[1]secretion

   SECRE'TION, n.

   1. The act of secerning; the act of the producing from the blood
   substances different from the blood itself, or from any of its
   constituents, as bile, saliva, mucus, urine, &c. This was considered
   0by the older physiologists as merely separation from the blood of
   certain substances previously contained in it; the literal meaning of
   secretion. But this opinion is generally exploded. The organs of
   secretion are of very various form and structure, but the most general
   are called glands.

   2. The matter secreted, as mucus, perspirable matter, &c.

[1]mucilage

   MU'CILAGE, n. [L. mucus, the slimy discharges from the nose; Heb. to
   dissolve, to putrefy.]

   1. In chimistry, one of the proximate elements of vegetables. The same
   substance is a gum when solid, and a mucilage when in solution.

   Both the ingredients improve one another; for the mucilage adds to the
   lubricity of the oil, and the oil preserves the mucilage from
   inspissation.

   Mucilage is obtained from vegetable or animal substances.

   2. The liquor which moistens and lubricates the ligaments and
   cartilages of the articulations or joints in animal bodies.

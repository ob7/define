   ACKNOWL'EDGMENT, n.

   1. The act of owning; confession; as, the acknowledgment of a fault.

   2. The owning, with approbation, or in the true character; as the
   acknowledgment of a God, or of a public minister.

   3. Concession; admission of the truth; as, of a fact, position, or
   principle.

   4. The owning of a benefit received, accompanied with gratitude; and
   hence it combines the ideas of an expression of thanks. Hence, it is
   used also for something given or done in return for a favor.

   5. A declaration or avowal of one's own act, to give it legal validity;
   as the acknowledgment of a deed before a proper officer.

   Acknowledgment-money, in some parts of England, is a sum paid by
   tenants, on the death of their landlord, as an acknowledgment of their
   new lords.

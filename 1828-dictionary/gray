   GRAY, a. [This is probably the name given to the Greeks, on account of
   their fair complexion compared with the Asiatics and Africans. [See
   Europe.] "Keto bore to Phorcus the Graiae with fair cheeks, white from
   their birth, and hence they were called Graiae." The Greek word is
   rendered an old woman, and in this passage of Hesiod, is supposed to
   mean certain deities. The probability is, that it is applied to an old
   woman, because she is gray. But the fable of Hesiod is easily explained
   by supposing the author to have had in his mind some imperfect account
   of the origin of the Greeks.]

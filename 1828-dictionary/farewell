[1]farewell

   FA'REWELL, a compound of fare, in the imperative, and well. Go well;
   originally applied to a person departing, but by custom now applied
   both to those who depart and those who remain. It expresses a kind
   wish, a wish of happiness to those who leave or those who are left.

   The verb and adverb are often separated by the pronoun; fare you well;
   I wish you a happy departure; may you be well in your absence.

   It is sometimes an expression of separation only. Farewell the year;
   farewell ye sweet groves; that is, I take my leave of you.

                                FA'REWELL, n.

   1. A wish of happiness or welfare at parting; the parting compliment;
   adieu.

   2. Leave; act of departure.

   And takes her farewell of the glorious sun.

   Before I take my farewell of the subject.

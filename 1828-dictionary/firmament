[1]firmament

   FIRMAMENT, n. ferm'ament. [L. firmamentum, from firmus, firmo.]

   The region of the air; the sky or heavens. In scripture, the word
   denotes an expanse, a wide extent; for such is the signification of the
   Hebrew word, coinciding with regio, region, and reach. The original
   therefore does not convey the sense of solidity, but of stretching,
   extension; the great arch or expanse over our heads, in which are
   placed the atmosphere and the clouds, and in which the stars appear to
   be placed, and are really seen.

   And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and
   let it divide the waters from the waters. Gen. 1:6.

   And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament.

                                 Ibum. 1:14.

   SLOPE, a. [This word contains the elements of L. labor, lapsus, and
   Eng. slip; also of L. levo. Eng. lift. I know not whether it originally
   signified ascending or descending, probably the latter.] Inclined or
   inclining form a horizontal direction; forming an angle with the plane
   of the horizon; as slope hills. [Little used.]

   SLOPE, n.

   1. An oblique direction; a line or direction inclining from a
   horizontal line; properly, a direction downwards.

   2. An oblique direction in general; a direction forming an angle with a
   perpendicular or other right line.

   3. A declivity; any ground whose surface forms an angle with the plane
   of the horizon; also, an acclivity, as every declivity must be also an
   acclivity.

   SLOPE, v.t. To form with a slope; to form to declivity or obliquity; to
    direct obliquely; to incline; as, to slope the ground in a garde; to
                slope a piece of cloth in cutting a garment.

   SLOPE, v.i. To take an oblique direction; to be declivous or inclined.

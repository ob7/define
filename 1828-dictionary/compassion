[1]compassion

   COMPASSION, n.

   1. A suffering with another; painful sympathy; a sensation of sorrow
   excited by the distress or misfortunes of another; pity; commiseration.
   Compassion is a mixed passion, compounded of love and sorrow; at least
   some portion of love generally attends the pain or regret, or is
   excited by it. Extreme distress of an enemy even changes enmity into at
   least temporary affection.

   He being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity. Ps. 78.

   His father had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed
   him. Luke 15.

                          COMPASSION, v.t. To pity.

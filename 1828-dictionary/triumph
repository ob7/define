   1. Among the ancient Romans, a pompous ceremony performed in honor of a
   victorious general, who was allowed to enter the city crowned,
   originally with laurel, but in later times with gold, bearing a
   truncheon in one hand and a branch of laurel in the other, riding in a
   chariot drawn by two white horses, and followed by the kings, princes
   and generals whom he had vanquished, loaded with chains and insulted by

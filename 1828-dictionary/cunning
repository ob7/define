   CUNNING, a. [G. See Can.]

   1. Knowing; skillful; experienced; well-instructed. It is applied to
   all kinds of knowledge, but generally and appropriately, to the skill
   and dexterity of artificers, or the knowledge acquired by experience.

   Esau was a cunning hunter. Genesis 23.

   I will take away the cunning artificer. Isaiah 3.

   A cunning workman. Exodus 38.

   2. Wrought with skill; curious; ingenious.

   With cherubs of cunning work shalt thou make them. Exodus 26.

   [The foregoing senses occur frequently in our version of the
   scriptures, but are nearly or quite obsolete.]

   3. Artful; shrewd; sly; crafty; astute; designing; as a cunning fellow.

   They are resolved to be cunning; let others run the hazard of being
   sincere.

   In this sense, the purpose or final end of the person may not be
   illaudalbe; but cunning implies the use of artifice to accomplish the
   purpose, rather than open, candid, or direct means. Hence,

   4. Deceitful; trickish; employing stratagems for a bad purpose.

   5. Assumed with subtilty; artful.

   Accounting his integrity to be but a cunning face of falsehood.

   Let my right hand forget her cunning. Psalm 137.

   2. Art; artifice; artfulness; craft; shrewdness; the faculty or act of
   using stratagem to accomplish a purpose. Hence in a bad sense,
   deceitfulness or deceit; fraudulent skill or dexterity.

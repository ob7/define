   BUFF'ET, n. A cupboard, or set of shelves, for plates, glass, china and
   other like furniture. It was formerly and is still in some parts of the
   country, an apartment erected on one side of a room; but in more
   fashionable houses,it has been laid aside, and a side board
   substituted, which is now considered as the buffet. But as far as my
   knowledge extends, the name has become, in a great measure, obsolete,
   except among the common people,by whom it is pronounced bofat.

   BUFF'ET, n. A blow with the fist; a box on the ear or face; a slap.

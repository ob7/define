   SHEAVE, n. In seamen's language, a wheel in which the rope works in a
   block. It is made of hard wood or a metal. When made of wood, it is
   sometimes bushed, that is, has a piece or perforated brass let into its
   center, the better to sustain the friction of the pin.

   SHEAVE, v.t. To bring together; to collect. [Not in use.]

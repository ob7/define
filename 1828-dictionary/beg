[1]beg

   BEG , n. In the Turkish dominions, a governor of a town or country;
   more particularly, the lord of a sangiac or banner. Every province is
   divided into seven sangiacs or banners, each of which qualifies a bey;
   and these are commanded by the governor of the province, called
   begler-beg or lord of all the beys. Each beg has the command of a
   certain number of spahis, or horse, denominated

   timariots.

   In Tunis, the beg or bey is the prince or king, answering to the dey of
   Algiers.

   In Egypt, the begs are twelve generals who command the militia, or
   standing forces of the kingdom.

   VARI'ETY, n. [L. varietas, from vario, to vary.]

   1. Intermixture of different things, or of things different in form; or
   a succession of different things.

   Variety is nothing else but a continued novelty.

   The variety of colors depends on the composition of light.

   2. One thing of many which constitute variety. In this sense, it has a
   plural; as the varieties of a species.

   3. Difference; dissimilitude.

   There is a variety in the tempers of good men.

   4. Variation; deviation; change from a former state. [Little used.]

   5. Many and different kinds. The shopkeeper has a great variety of
   cottons and silks.

   He wants to do a variety of good things.

   6. In natural history, a difference not permanent or invariable, but
   occasioned by an accidental change; as a variety of any species of
   plant.

   Naturalists formerly erred very much in supposing an accidental variety
   of plants, animals or minerals, to be a distinct species. Ray has
   established a good test for varieties in botany. A plant is distinct,
   which propagates itself in its own form by its seed; but when the
   difference disappears in the new plant, it is only a variety. Variety
   then is a difference between individuals, not permanent nor important
   enough to constitute a distinct species; such as in size, color,
   fullness, curling, &c.

   7. Different sort; as varieties of soil or land.

[1]celerity

   CELERITY, n.

   1. Rapidity in motion; swiftness; speed; applied most generally to
   bodies moving on or near the earth; as the celerity of horse or of a
   fowl. We speak of the velocity of sound or of light, or of a planet in
   its orbit. This distinction however is not general, nor can the
   different uses of the two words be precisely defined. We apply celerity
   rather than velocity to thought; but there seems to be no reason,
   except usage, why the two words should not be synonymous.

   2. An affection of motion by which a movable body runs through a given
   space in a given time.

[1]preside

   PRESI'DE, v.i. s as z. [L. proesideo; proe, before, and sedeo, to sit.]

   1. To be set over for the exercise of authority; to direct, control and
   govern, as the chief officer. A man may preside over a nation or
   province; or he may preside over a senate, or a meeting of citizens.
   The word is used chiefly in the latter sense. We say, a man presides
   over the senate with dignity. Hence it usually denotes temporary
   superintendence and government.

   2. To exercise superintendence; to watch over as inspector.

   Some o'er the public magazines preside.

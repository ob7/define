[1]symmetry

   SYM'METRY, n. [Gr. with, together, and to measure.] A due proportion of
   the several parts of a body to each other; adaptation of the dimensions
   of the several parts of a thing to each other; or the union and
   conformity of the members of a work to the whole. Symmetry arises from
   the proportion which the Greeks call analogy, which is the relation of
   conformity of all the parts to a certain measure; as the symmetry of a
   building or an animal body.

   Uniform symmetry, in architecture, is where the same ordonnance reigns
   throughout the whole.

   symmetry, is where only the opposite sides are equal to each other.

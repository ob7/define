   REDOUT', n. [L. reductus, reduco, to bring back; literally a retreat.
   The usual orthography, redoubt, is egregiously erroneous.]

   In fortification, an outwork; a small square fort without any defense,
   except in front; used in trenches, lines of circumvallation,
   contravallation and approach to defend passages, &c.

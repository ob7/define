   IMME'DIATE, a. [L. in and medius, middle.]

   1. Proximate; acting without a medium, or without the intervention of
   another cause or means; producing its effect by its own direct agency.
   An immediate cause is that which is exerted directly in producing its
   effect, in opposition to a mediate cause, or one more remote.

   2. Not acting by second causes; as the immediate will of God.

   3. Instant; present; without the intervention of time. We must have an
   immediate supply of bread.

   Immediate are my needs--

   Death--inflicted--by an immediate stroke.

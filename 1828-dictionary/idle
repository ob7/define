   Why stand ye here all the day idle? Matt.20.

   To be idle, is to be vicious.

   2. Slothful; given to rest and ease; averse to labor or employment;
   lazy; as an idle man; an idle fellow.

   3. Affording leisure; vacant; not occupied; as idle time; idle hours.

   4. Remaining unused; unemployed; applied to things; as, my sword or
   spear is idle.

   5. Useless; vain; ineffectual; as idle rage.

   8. Unprofitable; not tending to edification.

   Every idle word that men shall speak,they shall give an account thereof

   Idle differs from lazy; the latter implying constitutional or habitual
     aversion or indisposition to labor or action, sluggishness; whereas
    idle, in its proper sense, denotes merely unemployed. An industrious
                   man may be idle, but he cannot be lazy.

       I'DLE, v.i. To lose or spend time in inaction, or without being
                            employed in business.

   To idle away, in a transitive sense, to spend in idleness; as, to idle
                                 away time.

   RAG'STONE, n. A stone of the silicious kind, so named from its rough
   fracture. It is of a gray color, the texture obscurely laminar or
   rather fibrous, the lamins consisting of a congeries of grains of a
   quartzy appearance, coarse and rough. It effervesces with acids, and
   gives fire with steel. It is used for a whetstone without oil or water,
   for sharpening coarse cutting tools.

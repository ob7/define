[1]sagacious

   SAGA'CIOUS, a. [L. sagax, from sagus, wise, foreseeing; saga, a wise
   woman; sagio, to perceive readily. The latter signifies wise, prudent,
   sage, and an essay, which unites this word with seek, and L. sequor.]

   1. Quick of scent; as a sagacious hound; strictly perhaps, following by
   the scent, which sense is connected with L. sequor; with of; as
   sagacious of his quarry.

   2. Quick of thought; acute in discernment or penetration; as a
   sagacious head; a sagacious mind.

   I would give more for the criticisms of one sagacious enemy, than for
   those of a score of admirers.

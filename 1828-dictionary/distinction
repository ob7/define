   DISTINCTION, n. [L.]

   1. The act of separating or distinguishing.

   2. A note or mark of difference. [Seldom used.]

   3. Difference made; a separation or disagreement in kind or qualities,
   by which one thing is known from another. We observe a distinction
   between matter and spirit; a distinction between matter and spirit; a
   distinction between the animal and vegetable kingdoms; a distinction
   between good and evil, right and wrong; between sound reasoning and
   sophistry.

   4. Difference regarded; separation; preference; as in the phrase,
   without distinction, which denotes promiscuously, all together, alike.

   Maids, women, wives, without distinction fall.

   5. Separation; division; as the distinction of tragedy into acts.

   [In this sense, division would be preferable.]

   6. Notation of difference; discrimination; as a distinction between
   real and apparent good.

   In classing the qualities of actions, it is necessary to make accurate
   distinctions.

   7. Eminence; superiority; elevation of rank in society, or elevation of
   character; honorable estimation. Men who hold a high rank by birth or
   office, and men who are eminent fro their talents, services or worth,
   are called men of distinction, as being raised above others by positive
   institutions or by reputation. So we say, a man of note.

   8. That which confers eminence or superiority; office, rank or public
   favor.

   9. Discernment; judgment.

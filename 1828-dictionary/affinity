   AFFIN'ITY, n. [L. affinitas, from affinis, adjacent, related by
   marriage; ad and finis, end.]

   1. The relation contracted by marriage, between a husband and his
   wife's kindred, and between a wife and her husband's kindred; in
   contradistinction from consanguinity or relation by blood.

   Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh. 1Kings 3.

   2. Agreement; relation; conformity; resemblance; connection; as, the
   affinity of sounds, of colors, or of languages.

   3. In chimistry, attraction; elective attraction, or that tendency
   which different species of matter have to unite, and combine with
   certain other bodies, and the power that disposes them to continue in
   combination There are two kinds of affinity.

   1. Affinity of aggregation, which is the power that causes two
   homogeneous bodies to tend towards each other, unite and cohere, as two
   drops of water, which unite in one.

   2. Affinity of composition, which is the tendency of bodies of
   different kinds to unite and form new combinations of bodies with
   different properties. Such is the affinity which unites acids and
   alkalies, the results of which combination are neutral salts.

   The operations of this principle are various. When heterogeneous bodies
   have mutually an equal attraction, it is called compound affinity. When
   one substance decomposes a combination of others, unites with one of
   them and precipitates the other, the power is called the affinity of
   decomposition. When bodies will not unite, but by means of a third,
   which enables them to combine, this is affinity by means of a medium.

   Double affinity is when by means of four bodies, two decompositions and
   two new combinations are effected.

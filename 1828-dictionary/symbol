   SYM'BOL, n. [L. symbolum; Gr. with, and to throw; to compare.]

   1. The sign or representation of any moral thing by the images or
   properties of natural things. Thus the lion is the symbol of courage;
   the lamb is the symbol of meekness or patience. Symbols are of various
   kinds, as types, enigmas, parables, fables, allegories, emblems,
   hieroglyphics, &c.

   eucharist, the bread and wine are called symbols of the body and blood
   of Christ.

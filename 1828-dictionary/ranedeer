   RANEDEER, n.

   A species of deer found in the northern parts of Europe and Asia. He
   has large branched palmated horns, and travels with great speed. Among
   the Laplanders, he is a substitute for the horse, the cow, the goat and
   the sheep, as he furnishes food, clothing and the means of conveyance.
   This animal will draw a sled on the snow more than a hundred miles in a
   day.

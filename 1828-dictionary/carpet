   CARPET, n.

   1. A covering for floors, tables, stairs, &c. This covering is usually
   made of wool, wrought with a needle, or more generally in a loom, but
   is sometimes made of other materials. The manufacture is of Asiatic
   origin, but has been introduced into many parts of Europe, and into the
   United States.

   2. Level ground covered, as with grass; as a grassy carpet; a carpet of
   green grass.

   To be on the carpet, is to be under consideration; to be the subject of
   deliberation. The French phrase, to be on the tapis, is used in the
   like sense.

   Carpet-knight, in Shakspeare, is a knight who enjoys ease and security,
   or luxury, and has not known the hardships of the field.

   Carpet-monger is used in a like sense.

        CARPET, v.t. To cover with a carpet; to spread with carpets.

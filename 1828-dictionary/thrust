    [Note. Push and shove do not exactly express the sense of thrust. The
      two former imply the application of force by one body already in
     contact with the body to be impelled. Thrust on the contrary, often
   implies the impulse or application of force by a moving body, a body in
   motion before it reaches the body to be impelled. This distinction does
                         not extend to every case.]

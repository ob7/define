[1]spatter

   SPAT'TER, v.t. [This root is a derivative of the family of spit, or L.
   pateo. See Sputter.]

   1. To scatter a liquid substance on; to sprinkle with water or any
   fluid, or with any moist and dirty matter; as, to spatter a coat; to
   spatter the floor; to spatter the boots with mud. [This word, I
   believe, is applied always to fluid or moist substances. We say, to
   spatter with water, mud, blood or gravy; but never to spatter with dust
   or meal.]

   2. Figuratively, to asperse; to defame. [In this sense, asperse is
   generally used.]

   3. To throw out any thing offensive; as, to spatter foul speeches. [Not
   in use.]

   4. To scatter about; as, to spatter water here and there.

     SPAT'TER, v.i. To throw out of the mouth in a scattered manner; to
                           sputter. [See Sputter.]

[1]afford

   AFFO'RD, v.t. [ad and the root of forth, further. The sense is to send
   forth. But I have not found this precise word in the exact sense of the
   English, in any other language.]

   1. To yield or produce as fruit, profit, issues, or result. Thus, the
   earth affords grain; a well affords water; trade affords profit;
   distilled liquors afford spirit.

   2. To yield, grant or confer; as, a good life affords consolation in
   old age.

   3. To be able to grant or sell with profit or without loss; as, A can
   afford wine at a less price than B.

   4. To be able to expend without injury to one's estate; as, a man can
   afford a sum yearly in charity; or be able to bear expenses, or the
   price of the thing purchased; as, one man can afford to buy a farm,
   which another cannot.

   5. To be able without loss or with profit.

   The merchant can afford to trade for smaller profits.

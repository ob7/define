[1]gulf

   GULF, n.

   1. A recess in the ocean from the general line of the shore into the
   land, or a tract of water extending from the ocean or a sea into the
   land, between two points or promontories; a large bay; as the gulf of
   Mexico; the gulf of Venice; the gulf of Finland. A gulf and a bay
   differ only in extent. We apply bay to a large or small recess of the
   sea, as the bay of Biscay, the bay of Fundy; but gulf is applied only
   to a large extent of water.

   2. An abyss; a deep place in the earth; as the gulf of Avernus.

   3. A whirlpool; an absorbing eddy.

   4. Any thing insatiable.

   CAPITAL, a.

   1. Literally, pertaining to the head; as a capital bruise, in Milton, a
   bruise on the head.

   2. Figuratively, as the head is the highest part of a man, chief;
   principal; first in importance; as a capital city or town; the capital
   articles of religion.

   3. Punishable by loss of the head or of life; incurring the forfeiture
   of life; punishable with death; as, treason and murder are capital
   offenses or crimes.

   4. Taking away life, as a capital punishment; or affecting life, as a
   capital trial.

   5. Great, important, though perhaps not chief; as, a town possesses
   capital advantages for trade.

   Capital stock, is the sum of money or stock which a merchant, banker or
   manufacturer employs in his business; either the original stock, or
   that stock augmented. Also, the sum of money or stock which each
   partner contributes to the joint fund or stock of the partnership;
   also, the common fund or stock of the company, whether incorporated or
   not.

   A capital city or town is the metropolis or chief city of an empire,
   kingdom, state or province. The application of the epithet indicates
   the city to be the largest, or to be the seat of government, or both.
   In many instances, the capital, that is, the largest city, is not the
   seat of government.

   CAPITAL, n. The uppermost part of a column, pillar or pilaster, serving

   By the customary omission of the noun, to which the adjective, capital,
   refers, it stand for,

   1. The chief city or town in a kingdom or state; a metropolis.

   2. A large letter or type, in printing.

   3. A stock in trade, in manufactures, or in any business requiring the
   expenditure of money with a view to profit.

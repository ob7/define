[1]considering

   CONSIDERING, ppr. Fixing the mind on; meditating on; pondering; viewing
   with care and attention; deliberating on.

   Note. We have a peculiar use of this word, which may be a corruption
   for considered, or which may be a deviation from analogy by an
   insensible change in the structure of the phrase. It is not possible
   for us to act otherwise, considering the weakness of our nature. As a
   participle, this word must here refer to us, or the sentence cannot be
   resolved by any rule of English syntax. It should be correct to say, It
   is not possible for us to act otherwise, the weakness of our nature
   being considered; or We, considering the weakness of our nature, cannot
   act otherwise. But the latter phrase is better grammar, than it is
   sense. We use other participles in like manner; as, Allowing for tare,
   the weight could not be more than a hundred pounds. These and similar
   phrases are anomalous. But considering is no more a kind of
   conjunction, in such phrases, than it is a noun.

     CONSIDERING, n. The act of deliberating, or carefully attending to;
                  hesitation; as, many mazed considerings.

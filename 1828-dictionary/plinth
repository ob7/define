   In architecture, a flat square member in form of a brick, which serves
   as the foundation of a column; being the flat square table under the

   gives the name to the abacus or upper part of the Tuscan order, from
   its resemblance to the plinth.

   Plinth of a wall, two or three rows of bricks advanced from the wall in

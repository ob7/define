[1]pucker

   PUCK'ER, v.t. [L. pectus; Gr. signifies closely, densely, to cover.] To
   gather into small folds or wrinkles; to contract into ridges and
   furrows; to corrugate.

   His face pale and withered, and his skin puckered in wrinkles.

   It is usually followed by up; as, to pucker up cloth; but up is
   superfluous. It is a popular word, but not elegant.

          PUCK'ER, n. A fold or wrinkle, or a collection of folds.

   PRESU'ME, v.t. s as z. [L. proesumo; proe, before,and sumo, to take.]
   To take or suppose to be true or entitled to belief, without
   examination or positive proof, or on the strength of probability. We
   presume that a man is honest, who has not been known to cheat or
   deceive; but in this we are sometimes mistaken. In many cases, the law
   presumes full payment where positive evidence of it cannot be produced.

   We not only presume it may be so, but we actually find it so.

   In cases of implied contracts, the law presumes that a man has
   covenanted or contracted to do what reason and justice dictate.

      PRESU'ME, v.i. To venture without positive permission; as, we may
                              presume too far.

   1. To form confident or arrogant opinions; with on or upon, before the
   cause of confidence.

   This man presumes upon his parts.

   I will not presume so far upon myself.

   2. To make confident or arrogant attempts.

   In that we presume to see what is meet and convenient, better than God
   himself.

   3. It has on or upon sometimes before the thing supposed.

   Luther presumes upon the gift of continency.

               It is sometimes followed by of, but improperly.

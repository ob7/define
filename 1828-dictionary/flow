   FLOW, v.i. [L. fluo, contracted from fugo, for it forms fluri, fuctum.
   In one case, the word would agree with the root of blow, L. flo; in the
   other, with the root of fly.]

   1. To move along an inclined plane, or on descending ground, by the
   operation of gravity, and with a continual change of place among the
   particles or parts, as a fluid. A solid body descends or moves in mass,
   as a ball or a wheel; but in the flowing of liquid substances, and
   others consisting of very fine particles, there is a constant change of
   the relative position of some parts of the substance, as in the case
   with a stream of water, of quicksilver, and of sand. Particles at the
   bottom and sides of the stream, being somewhat checked by friction,
   move slower than those in the middle and near the surface of the
   current. Rivers flow from springs and lakes; tears flow from the eyes.

   2. To melt; to become liquid.

   That the mountains might flow down at they presence.

                                   Is. 64.

   3. To proceed; to issue. Evils flow from different sources. Wealth
   flows from industry and economy. All our blessings flow from divine
   bounty

   4. To abound; to have in abundance.

   In that day the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall
   flow with milk. Joel 3.

   5. To be full; to be copious; as flowing cups or goblets.

   6. To glide along smoothly, without harshness or asperity; as a flowing
   period; flowing numbers.

   7. To be smooth, as composition or utterance. The orator has a flowing
   tongue.

   Virgil is sweet and flowing in his hexameters.

   8. To hang loose and waving; as a flowing mantle; flowing locks.

   The imperial purple flowing in his train.

   9. To rise, as the tide; opposed to ebb. The tide flows twice in twenty
   four hours.

   10. To move in the arteries and veins of the body; to circulate, as
   blood.

   11. To issue, as rays or beams of light.

   Light flows from the sun.

   12. To move in a stream, as air.

      FLOW, v.t. To cover with water; to overflow; to inundate. The low
                grounds along the river are annually flowed.

[1]sedition

   SEDI''TION, n. [L. seditio. The sense of this word is the contrary of
   that which is naturally deducible from sedo, or sedeo, denoting a
   rising or raging, rather than an appeasing. But to set is really to
   throw down, to drive, and sedition may be a setting or rushing
   together.] A factious commotion of the people, a tumultuous assembly of
   men rising in opposition to law or the administration of justice, and
   in disturbance of the public peace. Sedition is a rising or commotion
   of less extent than an insurrection, and both are less than rebellion;
   but some kinds of sedition, in Great Britain, amount to high treason.
   In general, sedition is a local or limited insurrection in opposition
   to civil authority, as mutiny is to military.

   MIN'ERAL, n. [Low L. minera, a matrix or vein of metals, whence
   mineralia; all from mine.]

   A body destitute of organization, and which naturally exists within the
   earth or at its surface.

   Minerals were formerly divided into salts, earths, inflammables and
   ores; a division which serves for a general distribution, but a more
   scientific arrangement into classes, orders, genera, species,
   subspecies and varieties, has been adopted to meet the more precise
   views of modern mineralogists.

   MIN'ERAL, a. Pertaining to minerals; consisting of fossil substances;
   as the mineral kingdom.

   1. Impregnated with minerals or fossil matter; as mineral waters; a
   mineral spring.

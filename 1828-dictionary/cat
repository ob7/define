   CAT, n.

   1. A name applied to certain species of carnivorous quadrupeds, of the
   genus Felis. The domestic cat needs no description. It is a deceitful
   animal, and when enraged, extremely spiteful. It is kept in houses,
   chiefly for the purpose of catching rats and mice. The wild cat is much
   larger than the domestic cat. It is a strong, ferocious animal, living
   in the forest, and very destructive to poultry and lambs.

   The wild cat of Europe is of the same species with the domestic cat;
   the catamount, of N. America, is much larger and a distinct species.

   2. A ship formed on the Norwegian model, having a narrow stern,
   projecting quarters, and a deep waist. It is strong built, from four to
   six hundred tons burthen, and employed in the coal trade.

   3. A strong tackle or combination of pulleys, to hook and draw an
   anchor perpendicularly up to the cat-head of a ship.

   4. A double tripod having six feet.

   Cat of nine tails, an instrument of punishment, consisting of nine
   pieces of line or cord fastened to a piece of thick rope, and having
   three knots at intervals, used to flog offenders on board of ships.

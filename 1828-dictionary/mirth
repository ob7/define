   MIRTH, n. merth. Social merriment; hilarity; high excitement of
   pleasurable feelings in company; noisy gayety; jollity. Mirth differs
   from joy and cheerfulness, as always implying noise.

   With genial joy to warm the soul,

   Bright Helen mixed a mirth-inspiring bowl.

   I will cause to cease the voice of mirth from Judah and Jerusalem.
   Jer.7.

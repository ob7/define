   SUN'SHINE, n. [sun and shine.] The light of the sun, or the place where
   it shines; the direct rays of the sun, or the place where they fall.

   But all sunshine, as when his beams at noon

   Culminate from th' equator.

   1. A place warmed and illuminated; warmth; illumination.

   The man that sits within a monarch's heart,

   And ripens in the sunshine of his favor.

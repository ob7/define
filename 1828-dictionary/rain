   RAIN, v.i. [It seems that rain is contracted from regen. It is the Gr.
   to rain, to water, which we retain in brook, and the Latins, by
   dropping the prefix, in rigo, irrigo, to irrigate. The primary sense is
   to pour out, to drive forth. Heb.]

   1. To fall in drops from the clouds, as water; used mostly with it for
   a nominative; as, it rains; it will rain; it rained, or it has rained.

   2. To fall or drop like rain; as, tears rained at their eyes.

     RAIN, v.t. To pour or shower down from the upper regions, like rain
                              from the clouds.

   Then said the Lord to Moses, behold I will rain bread from heaven for
   you. Ex. 14.

   God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon
   him while he is eating. Job. 20.

   Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and horrible
   tempest. Ps. 11.

    RAIN, n. The descent of water in drops from the clouds; or the water
      thus falling. Rain is distinguished from mist, by the size of the
     drops, which are distinctly visible. When water falls in very small
    drops or particles, we call it mist, and fog is composed of particles
       so fine as to be not only indistinguishable, but to float or be
                            suspended in the air.

[1]vacuum

   VAC'UUM, n. [L.] Space empty or devoid of all matter or body. Whether
   there is such a thing as an absolute vacuum in nature, is a question
   which has been much controverted. The Peripatetics assert that nature
   abhors a vacuum.

   Torricellian vacuum, the vacuum produced by filling a tube with
   mercury, and allowing it to descend till it is counterbalanced by the
   weight of the atmosphere, as in the barometer invented by Torricelli.

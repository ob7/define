   RA'INBOW, n. A bow, or an arch of a circle, consisting of all the
   colors formed by the refraction and reflection of rays of light from
   drops of rain or vapor, appearing in the part of the hemisphere
   opposite to the sun. When the sun is at the horizon, the rainbow is a
   semicircle. The rainbow is called also iris.

   The moon sometimes forms a bow or arch of light, more faint than that
   formed by the sun, and called lunar rainbow. Similar bows at sea are
   called marine rainbows or sea bows.

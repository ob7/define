   TRAP, n.

   1. An engine that shuts suddenly or with a spring, used for taking
   game; as a trap for foxes. A trap is a very different thing from a
   snare; though the latter word may be used in a figurative sense for a
   trap.

   2. An engine for catching men. [Not used in the U. States.]

   3. An ambush; a stratagem; any device by which men or other animals may
   be caught unawares.

   Let their table be made a snare and a trap. Rom.11.

   4. A play in which a ball is driven with a stick.

      TRAP, n. In mineralogy, a name given to rocks characterized by a
     columnar form, or whose strata or beds have the form of steps or a
   series of stairs. Kirwan gives this name to two families of basalt. It
     is now employed to designate a rock or aggregate in which hornblend
    predominates, but it conveys no definite idea of any one species; and
        under this term are comprehended hornblend, hornblend slate,
     greenstone, greenstone slate, amygdaloid, basalt, wacky, clinkstone
   porphyry, and perhaps hypersthene rock, augite rock, and some varieties
                                 of sienite.

         TRAP, v.t. To catch in a trap; as, to trap foxes or beaver.

   1. To ensnare; to take by stratagem.

   I trapp'd the foe.

   2. To adorn; to dress with ornaments. [See Trappings.] [the verb is
   little used.]

          TRAP, v.i. To set traps for game; as, to trap for beaver.

   HETEROS'CIAN, n. [Gr. other, and shadow.]

   Those inhabitants of the earth are called Heteroscians, whose shadows
   fall one way only. Such are those who live between the tropics and the
   polar circles. The shadows of those who live north of the tropic of
   Cancer, fall northward; those of the inhabitants south of the tropic of
   Capricorn, fall southward; whereas the shadows of those who dwell
   between the tropics fall sometimes to the north and sometimes to the
   south.

   HETEROS'CIAN, a. Having the shadow fall one way only.

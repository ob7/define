   SEDU'CTION, n. [L. seductio.]

   1. The act of seducing or of enticing from the path of duty.

   2. Appropriately, the act or crime of persuading a female, by flattery
   or deception, to surrender her chastity. A woman who is above flattery,
   is least liable to seduction; but the best safeguard is principle, the
   love and purity of holiness, the fear of God and reverence forHis
   commandments.

   ASSENT', n. [L. assensus, from assentior, to assent, of ad and sentio,
   to thing.]

   1. The act of the mind in admitting, or agreeing to, the truth of a
   proposition.

   Faith is the assent to any proposition, on the credit of the proposer.

   2. Consent; agreement to a proposal, respecting some right or interest;
   as, the bill before the house has the assent of a great majority of the
   members.

   The distinction between assent and consent seems to be this: assent is
   the agreement to an abstract proposition. We assent to a statement, but
   we do not consent to it. Consent is an agreement to some proposal or
   measure which affects the rights or interest of the consenter. We
   consent to a proposal of marriage. This distinction however is not
   always observed. [See Consent.]

   3. Accord; agreement. 2Chron. 18.

   LIB'ERTY, n. [L. libertas, from liber, free.]

   1. Freedom from restraint, in a general sense, and applicable to the
   body, or to the will or mind. The body is at liberty, when not
   confined; the will or mind is at liberty, when not checked or
   controlled. A man enjoys liberty, when no physical force operates to
   restrain his actions or volitions.

   2. Natural liberty, consists in the power of acting as one thinks fit,
   without any restraint or control, except from the laws of nature. It is
   a state of exemption from the control of others, and from positive laws
   and the institutions of social life. This liberty is abridged by the
   establishment of government.

   3. Civil liberty, is the liberty of men in a state of society, or
   natural liberty, so far only abridged and restrained, as is necessary
   and expedient for the safety and interest of the society, state or
   nation. A restraint of natural liberty, not necessary or expedient for
   the public, is tyranny or oppression. civil liberty is an exemption
   from the arbitrary will of others, which exemption is secured by
   established laws, which restrain every man from injuring or controlling
   another. Hence the restraints of law are essential to civil liberty.

   The liberty of one depends not so much on the removal of all restraint
   from him, as on the due restraint upon the liberty of others.

   In this sentence, the latter word liberty denotes natural liberty.

   4. Political liberty, is sometimes used as synonymous with civil
   liberty. But it more properly designates the liberty of a nation, the
   freedom of a nation or state from all unjust abridgment of its rights
   and independence by another nation. Hence we often speak of the
   political liberties of Europe, or the nations of Europe.

   5. Religious liberty, is the free right of adopting and enjoying
   opinions on religious subjects, and of worshiping the Supreme Being
   according to the dictates of conscience, without external control.

   6. Liberty, in metaphysics, as opposed to necessity, is the power of an
   agent to do or forbear any particular action, according to the
   determination or thought of the mind, by which either is preferred to
   the other.

   Freedom of the will; exemption from compulsion or restraint in willing
   or volition.

   7. Privilege; exemption; immunity enjoyed by prescription or by grant;
   with a plural. Thus we speak of the liberties of the commercial cities
   of Europe.

   8. Leave; permission granted. The witness obtained liberty to leave the
   court.

   9. A space in which one is permitted to pass without restraint, and
   beyond which he may not lawfully pass; with a plural; as the liberties
   of a prison.

   10. Freedom of action or speech beyond the ordinary bounds of civility
   or decorum. Females should repel all improper liberties.

   To take the liberty to do or say any thing, to use freedom not
   specially granted.

   To set at liberty, to deliver from confinement; to release from
   restraint.

   To be at liberty, to be free from restraint.

   Liberty of the press, is freedom from any restriction on the power to
   publish books; the free power of publishing what one pleases, subject
   only to punishment for abusing the privilege, or publishing what is
   mischievous to the public or injurious to individuals.

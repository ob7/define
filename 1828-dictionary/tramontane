   TRAMON'TANE, n. One living beyond the mountain; a stranger.

   TRAMON'TANE, a. [L. trans, beyond, and mons, mountain.] Lying or being
   beyond the mountain; foreign; barbarous. The Italian painters apply
   this epithet to all such as live north of the Alps, as in Germany and
   France; and a north wind is called a tramontane wind. The French
   lawyers call certain Italian canonists tramontane or ultramontane
   doctors; considering them as favoring too much the court of Rome.

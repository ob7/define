[1]admiration

   ADMIRA'TION, n. Wonder mingled with pleasing emotions, as approbation,
   esteem, love or veneration; a compound emotion excited by something
   novel, rare, great, or excellent; applied to persons and their works.
   It often includes a slight degree of surprise. Thus, we view the solar
   system with admiration.

   Very near to admiration is the wish to admire.

   It has been sometimes used in an ill sense, denoting wonder with
   disapprobation.

   Your boldness I with admiration see.

   When I saw her I wondered with great admiration. Luke 18.

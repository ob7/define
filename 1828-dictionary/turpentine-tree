   TUR'PENTINE-TREE, n. A tree of the genus Pistacia, which produces not
   only its proper fruit, but a kind of horn which grows on the surface of
   its leaves. This is found to be an excrescence, the effect of the
   puncture of an insect, and is produced in the same manner as the galls
   of other plants.

[1]clever

   CLEVER, a.

   1. Fit; suitable; convenient; proper; commodious.

   2. Dextrous; adroit; ready; that performs with skill or address.

   3. In New England, good-natured, possessing an agreeable mind or
   disposition. In Great Britain, this word is applied to the body or its
   movements, in its literal sense; in America, it is applied chiefly to
   the mind, temper, disposition. In Great Britain, a clever man is a
   dextrous man, one who performs and act with skill or address. In
   New-England, a clever man is a man of a pleasing obliging disposition,
   and amiable manners, but often implying a moderate share of talents.
   Fitness, suitableness, gives both senses analogically; the former
   applied to the body; the latter, to the mind, or its qualities. It is a
   colloquial word, but sometimes found in respectable writings.

   In some of the United States, it is said this word is applied to the
   intellect, denoting ingenious, knowing, discerning.

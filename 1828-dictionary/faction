[1]faction

   FAC'TION, n. [L. factio, from facio, to make or do.]

   1. A party, in political society, combined or acting in union, in
   opposition to the prince, government or state; usually applied to a
   minority, but it may be applied to a majority. sometimes a state is
   divided into factions nearly equal. Rome was almost always disturbed by
   factions. Republics are proverbial for factions, and factions in
   monarchies have often effected revolutions.

   A feeble government produces more factions than an oppressive one.

   By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a
   majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some
   common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of
   other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the
   community.

   2. Tumult; discord; dissension.

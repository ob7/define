[1]disabuse

   DISABUSE, v.t. disabuze. [See Abuse.] To free from mistake; to
   undeceive; to disengage from fallacy or deception; to set right. It is
   our duty to disabuse ourselves of false notions and prejudices.

   If men are now sufficiently enlightened to disabuse themselves of
   artifice, hypocrisy and superstition, they will consider this event as
   an era in their history.

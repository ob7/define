[1]scald

   SCALD, v.t. [L. caleo, caida, calidus. I suppose the primary sense of
   caleo is to contract, to draw, to make hard.]

   1. To burn or painfully affect and injure by immersion in or contact
   with a liquor of a boiling heat, or a heat approaching it; as, to scald
   the hand or foot. We scald the part, when the heat of the liquor
   applied is so violent as to injure the skin and flesh. Scald is
   sometimes used to express the effect of the heat of other substances
   than liquids.

   Here the blue flames of scalding brimstone fall.

   2. To expose to a boiling or violent heat over a fire, or in water or
   other liquor; as, to scald meat or milk.

      SCALD, n. [supra.] A burn, or injury to the skin and flesh by hot
                                   liquor.

                     SCALD, n. Scab; scurf on the head.

              SCALD, a. Scurvy; paltry; poor; as scald rhymers.

                                  SCALD, n.

   Among the ancient Scandinavians, a poet; one whose occupation was to
   compose poems in honor of distinguished men and their achievements, and
   to recite and sing them on public occasions. The scalds of Denmark and
   Sweden answered to the bards of the Britons or Celts.

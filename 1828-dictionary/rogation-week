   ROGA'TION-WEEK, n. The second week before Whitsunday, thus called from
   the three fasts observed therein; viz, on Monday, Tuesday, and
   Wednesday, called rogation-days, because of the extraordinary prayers
   then made for the fruits of the earth, or as a preparation for the
   devotion of the Holy Thursday.

   GRIEF ,n. [L. gravis.]

   1. The pain of mind produced by loss, misfortune, injury or evils of
   any kind; sorrow; regret. We experience grief when we lose a friend,
   when we incur loss, when we consider ourselves injured, and by
   sympathy, we feel grief at the misfortunes of others.

   2. The pain of mind occasioned by our own misconduct; sorrow or regret
   that we have done wrong; pain accompanying repentance. We feel grief
   when we have offended or injured a friend, and the consciousness of
   having offended the Supreme Being, fills the penitent heart with the
   most poignant grief.

   3. Cause of sorrow; that which afflicts.

   Who were a grief of mind to Isaac and Rebekah. Gen.26.

   A foolish son is a grief to his father. Prov.17.

   SLA'VERY, n. [See Slave.]

   1. Bondage; the state of entire subjection of one person to the will of
   another. Slavery is the obligation to labor for the benefit of the
   master, without the contract of consent of the servant. Slavery may
   proceed from crimes, from captivity or from debt. Slavery is also
   voluntary or involuntary; voluntary, when a person sells or yields his
   own person to the absolute command of another; involuntary, when he is
   placed under the absolute power of another without his own consent.
   Slavery no longer exists in Great Britain, not in the northern states
   of America.

   2. The offices of a slave; drudgery.

[1]a

   A is the first letter of the Alphabet in most of the known languages of
   the earth; in the Ethiopic, however it is the thirteenth, and in the
   Runic the tenth. It is naturally the first letter, because it
   represents the first vocal sound naturally formed by the human organs;
   being the sound uttered with a mere opening of the mouth without
   constraint, and without any effort to alter the natural position or
   configuration of the lips. The A has been proven to be the first
   natural vocal sound, and entitled to the first place in alphabets.

   A has in English, three sounds; the long or slender, as in place, fate;
   the broad, as in wall, fall, which is shortened in salt, what; and the
   open, as in father, glass, which is shortened in rather, fancy. Its
   primitive sound was probably aw. A is also an abbreviation used before
   words beginning with an articulation; as a table, instead of an table,
   or one table. This is a modern change.

   This letter serves as a prefix to many English words, as in asleep;
   awake; afoot; aground; agoing. In some cases, this is a contraction of
   Teutonic ge, as in asleep, aware, from the Saxon geslapan, to sleep, to
   beware. Sometimes it is a corruption of the Saxon on, as again from
   ongean , awake from onwacian to watch or wake. Before participles, it
   may be a contraction of the Celtic ag, the sign of the participle of
   the present tense; as, ag-radh, saying; a saying, a going. Or this may
   be a contraction of on, or what is equally probable, it may have
   proceeded from a mere accidental sound produced by negligent utterance.
   In some words, a may be a contraction of at, of, in, to, or an. In some
   words of Greek original, a is privative, giving to them a negative
   sense, as in anonymous.

   Among the ancients, A was a numeral denoting 500, and with a dash A
   5000. In the Julian Calendar, A is the first of the seven dominical
   letters.

   Among logicians, A, as an abbreviation, stands for a universal
   affirmative proposition. A asserts; E denies. Thus in barbara, a thrice
   repeated denotes so many of the propositions to be universal.

   The Romans used A to signify a negative or dissent in giving their
   votes; A standing for antiquo, I oppose or object to the proposed law.
   Opposed to this letter were U R, uti rogas, be it as you desire - the
   words used to express assent to a proposition. These letters were
   marked on wooden ballots, and each voter had an affirmative and a
   negative put into his hands, one of which at pleasure he gave as his
   vote, - In criminal trials, A stood for absolvo, I acquit, C for
   condemno, I condemn; and N L for non liquet, it is not evident; and the
   judges voted by ballots this marked. In inscriptions, A stands for
   Augustus; or for ager, aiunt, , aurum, argentum, &c.

   A is also used for anno, or ante; as in Anno Domini, the year of our
   Lord; anno mundi, the year of the world; ante meridiem, before noon,
   and for arts, in artium magister, master of arts.

   In algebra, a and first letters of the alphabet represent known
   quantities - the last letters are sometimes used to represent unknown
   quantities.

   music, A is the nominal of the sixth note in the natural diatonic scale
   - called by Guido la. It is also the name of one of the two natural
   moods; and it is the open note of the 2d string of the violin, by which
   the other strings are tuned and regulated.

   In pharmacy, a or aa, abbreviations of the Greek ana, signify of each
   separately, or that the things mentioned should be taken in quantities
   of the same weight or measure.

   In chimistry, A A A stand for amalgama, or amalgamation.

   In commerce, A stands for accepted, as in case of a bill of exchange.
   Merchants also number their books by the letters - A,B,C, instead of
   figures. Public officers number their exhibits in the same manner; as
   the document A, or B.

   Alpha and Omega, the first and last letters of the Greek Alphabet, are
   used in Scripture for the beginning and end - representative of Christ.

   In mathematics, letters are used as representatives of numbers, lines,
   angles and quantities. In arguments, letters are substituted for
   persons, in cases supposed, or stated for illustration, as A contracts
   with B to deliver property to D. - In the English phraseology "a
   landlord as a hundred a year," " the sum amounted to ten dollars a
   man," a is merely the adjective one, and this mode of expression is
   idiomatic; a hundred in a year; ten dollars to a man.

   FOR'EST, n. [L. foris.]

   1. An extensive wood, or a large tract of land covered with trees. In
   America, the word is usually applied to a wood of native growth, or a
   tract of woodland which has never been cultivated. It differs from wood
   or woods chiefly in extent. We read of the Hercynian forest, in
   Germany, and the forest of Ardennes, in France or Gaul.

   2. In law, in Great Britain, a certain territory of woody grounds and
   pastures, privileged for wild beasts and fowls of forest, chase and
   warren, to rest and abide in, under the protection of the king, for his
   pleasure. In this sense, the word has no application in America.

   Forest laws, laws for governing and regulating forests, and preserving
   game.

                 FOR'EST, v.t. To cover with trees or wood.

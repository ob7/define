   INDIF'FERENT, a. [L. indifferens.]

   1. Neutral; not inclined to one side, party or thing more than to
   another.

   Cato knows neither of them,

   Indifferent in his choice to sleep or die.

   2. Unconcerned; feeling no interest,anxiety or care respecting any
   thing. It seems to be impossible that a rational being should be
   indifferent to the means of obtaining endless happiness.

   It was a remarkable law of Solon, that any person who, in the
   commotions of the republic, remained neuter, or an indifferent
   spectator of the contending parties, should be condemned to perpetual
   banishment.

   3. Having no influence or preponderating weight; having no difference
   that gives a preference. It is indifferent which road we take.

   4. Neutral, as to good or evil. Things in themselves indifferent, may
   be rendered evil by the prohibition of law.

   5. Impartial; disinterested; as an indifferent judge, juror or
   arbitrator.

   6. Passable; of a middling state or quality; neither good, nor the
   worst; as indifferent writing or paper.

   Indifferent, used adverbially, as indifferent honest, is ungrammatical
                                 and vulgar.

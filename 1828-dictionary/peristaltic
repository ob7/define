   PERISTAL'TIC, a. [Gr. to involve.] Spiral; vermicular or worm-like. The
   peristaltic motion of the intestines is performed by the contraction of
   the circular and longitudinal fibers composing their fleshy coats, by
   which the chyle is driven into the orifices of the lacteals, and the
   excrements are protruded towards the anus.

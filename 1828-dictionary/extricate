[1]extricate

   EX'TRICATE, v.t. [L. extrico. The primary verb trico is not in the
   Latin. We probably see its affinities in the Gr. hair, or a bush of
   hair, from interweaving, entangling. I suspect that three is contracted
   from this root; three for threg, folded, or a plexus. The same word
   occurs in intricate and intrigue; Eng. trick.

   1. Properly, to disentangle; hence, to free from difficulties or
   perplexities; to disembarrass; as, to extricate one from complicated
   business, from troublesome alliances or other connections; to extricate
   one's self from debt.

   2. To set out; to cause to be emitted or evolved.

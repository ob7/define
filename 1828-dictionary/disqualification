   DISQUALIFICATION, n. [See Disqualitfy.]

   1. The act of disqualifying; or that which disqualifies; that which
   renders unfit, unsuitable or inadequate; as, sickness is a
   disqualification for labor or study.

   2. The act of depriving of legal power or capacity; that which renders
   incapable; that which incapacitates in law; disability. Conviction of a
   crime is a disqualification for office.

   3. Want of qualification. It is used in this sense, though improperly.
   In strictness, disqualification implies a previous qualification; but
   careless writers use it for the want of qualification, where no
   previous qualification is supposed. Thus, I must still retain the
   consciousness of those disqualifications, which you have been pleased
   to overlook.

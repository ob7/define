   MAN, n. plu. men. [Heb.species, kind, image, similitude.]

   1. Mankind; the human race; the whole species of human beings; beings
   distinguished from all other animals by the powers of reason and
   speech, as well as by their shape and dignified aspect. "Os homini
   sublime dedit."

   And God said, Let us make man in our image, , after our likeness, and
   let them have dominion--Gen.1.

   Man that is born of a woman, is of few days and full of trouble.
   Job.14.

   My spirit shall not always strive with man. Gen.6.

   I will destroy man whom I have created. Gen.6.

   There hath no temptation taken you, but such as is common to man. 1
   Cor.10.

   It is written,man shall not live by bread alone. Matt.4.

   There must be somewhere such a rank as man.

   Respecting man, whatever wrong we call--

   But vindicate the ways of God to man.

   The proper study of mankind is man.

   In the System of Nature, man is ranked as a distinct genus.

    When opposed to woman, man sometimes denotes the male sex in general.

       Woman has, in general, much stronger propensity than man to the
                        discharge of parental duties.

   2. A male individual of the human race, of adult growth or years.

   The king is but a man as I am.

   And the man dreams but what the boy believed.

   3. A male of the human race; used often in compound words, or in the
   nature of an adjective; as a man-child; men-cooks; men-servants.

   4. A servant, or an attendant of the male sex.

   I and my man will presently go ride.

   5. A word of familiar address.

   We speak no treason, man.

   6. It sometimes bears the sense of a male adult of some uncommon
   qualifications; particularly,the sense of strength, vigor, bravery,
   virile powers, or magnanimity, as distinguished from the weakness,
   timidity or impotence of a boy, or from the narrow mindedness of low
   bred men.

   I dare do all that may become a man.

   Will reckons he should not have been the man he is, had he not broke
   windows--

   So in popular language, it is said, he is no man. Play your part like a
                    man. He has not the spirit of a man.

   Thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth. 1 Sam.17.

   7. An individual of the human species.

   In matters of equity between man and man--

        Under this phraseology, females may be comprehended. So a law
   restraining man, or every man from a particular act, comprehends women
        and children, if of competent age to be the subjects of law.

   8. Man is sometimes opposed to boy or child, and sometimes to beast.

   9. One who is master of his mental powers, or who conducts himself with
   his usual judgment. When a person has lost his senses, or acts without
   his usual judgment, we say, he is not his own man.

        10. It is sometimes used indefinitely, without reference to a
    particular individual; any person; one. This is as much as a man can
                                   desire.

   A man, in an instant,may discover the assertion to be impossible.

    This word however is always used in the singular number, referring to
   an individual. In this respect it does not answer to the French on, nor
       to the use of man by our Saxon ancestors. In Saxon, man ofsloh,
      signifies,they slew; man sette ut, they set or fitted out. So in
    German, man sagt,may be rendered, one ways, it is said, they say, or
    people say. So in Danish, man siger, one says, it is said, they say.

                      11. In popular usage, a husband.

   Every wife ought to answer for her man.

                  12. A movable piece at chess or draughts.

           13. In feudal law, a vassal, a liege subject or tenant.

   The vassal or tenant, kneeling, ungirt,uncovered and holding up his
   hands between those of his lord, professed that he did become his man,
   from that day forth, of life, limb, and earthly honor.

                  Man of war, a ship or war; an armed ship.

[1]congelation

   CONGELATION, n. [L.] The process of passing, or the act of converting,
   from a fluid to a solid state; or the state of being congealed;
   concretion. It differ from crystalization in this; in congelation the
   whole substance of a fluid may become solid; in crystalization, when a
   salt is formed, a portion of liquid is left. But the congelation of
   water is a real crystalization.

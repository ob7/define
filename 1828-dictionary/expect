[1]expect

   EXPECT', v.t. [L. expecto; ex and specto, to look, that is, to reach
   forward, or to fix the eyes.]

   1. To wait for.

   The guards,

   By me encamp'd on yonder hill, expect

   Their motion.

   [This sense, though often used by Gibbon, seems to be obsolescent.]

   2. To look for; to have a previous apprehension of something future,
   whether good or evil; to entertain at least a slight belief that an
   event will happen. We expect a visit that has been promised. We expect
   money will be paid at the time it is due, though we are often
   disappointed.

    Expect, in its legitimate sense, always refers to a future event. The
       common phrase, I expect it was, is a vulgar as it is improper.

   STYLE, n. [L., Gr., a column, a pen or bodkin; from the root of the

   capillary, filiform, cylindric, subulate, or clavate.

   12. In chronology, a mode of reckoning time, with regard to the Julian
   and Gregorian calendar. Style is Old or New. The Old Style follows the
   Julian manner of computing the months and days, or the calendar as
   established by Julius Cesar, in which the year consists of 365 days and
   6 hours. This is something more than 11 minutes too much, and in the
   course of time, between Cesar and pope Gregory XIII, this surplus
   amounted to 11 days. Gregory reformed the calendar by retrenching 11
   days; this reformation was adopted by act of parliament in Great
   Britain in 1751, by which act eleven days in September, 1752 were
   retrenched, and the 3rd day was reckoned the 14th. This mode of
   reckoning is called New Style.

     STYLE, v.t. To call; to name; to denominate; to give a title to in
   addressing. The emperor of Russia is styled autocrat; the king of Great
                  Britain is styled defender of the faith.

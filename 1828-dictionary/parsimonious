[1]parsimonious

   PARSIMO'NIOUS, a. [See Parsimony.] Sparing in the use or expenditure of
   money; covetous; near; close. It differs from frugal, in implying more
   closeness or narrowness of mind, or an attachment to property somewhat
   excessive, or a disposition to spend less money that is necessary or
   honorable.

   Extraordinary funds for one campaign may spare us the expense of many
   years; whereas a long parsimonious war will drain us of more men and
   money.

   [It is sometimes used in a good sense for frugal.]

   FIT, n. [L. peto, impeto, to assult, or to Eng. pet, and primarily to
   denote a rushing on or attach, or a start. See fit, suitable.]

   1. The invasion, exacerbation or paroxysm of a disease. We apply the
   word to the return of an ague, after intermission, as a cold fit. We
   apply it to the first attack, or to the return of other diseases, as a
   fit of the gout or stone; and in general, to a disease however
   continued, as a fit of sickness.

   2. A sudden and violent attack of disorder, in which the body is often
   convulsed, and sometimes senseless; as a fit of apoplexy or epilepsy;
   hysteric fits.

   3. Any short return after intermission; a turn; a period or interval.
   He moves by fits and starts.

   By fits my swelling grief appears.

   4. A temporary affection or attack; as a fit of melancholy, or of
   grief; a fit of pleasure.

   5. Disorder; distemperature.

   6. Anciently, a song, or part of a song; a strain; a canto.

   FIT, a. [This is from the root of Eng. pass; pat. In L. competo, whence
   compatible, signifies properly to meet or to fall on, hence to suit or
   be fit, from peto. This is probably the same word. The primary sense is
    to come to, to fall on, hence to meet, to extend to, to be close, to
       suit. To come or fall, is the primary sense of time or season.]

   1. Suitable; convenient; meet; becoming.

   Is it fit to say to a king, thou art wicked? Job 34.

   Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.
   Col. 3.

   2. Qualified; as men of valor fit for war.

   No man having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for
   the kingdom of God. Luke 9.

                                  FIT, v.t.

   1. To adapt; to suit; to make suitable.

   The carpenter - marketh it out like a line, he fitteth it with planes.
   Is. 44.

   2. To accommodate a person with any thing; as, the tailor fits his
   customer with a coat. The original phrase is, he fits a coat to his
   customer. But the phrase implies also furnishing, providing a thing
   suitable for another.

   3. To prepare; to put in order for; to furnish with things proper or
   necessary; as, to fit a ship for a long voyage. Fit yourself for action
   or defense.

   1. To be proper or becoming.

   Nor fits it to prolong the feast.

   2. To suit or be suitable; to be adapted. His coat fits very well. But
   this is an elliptical phrase.

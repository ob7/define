   GEHLENITE, n. [from Gehlen, the chimist.]

   A mineral recently discovered, in the description of which authors are
   not perfectly agreed. According to the description and analysis of
   Fuchs, it appears to be a variety of idocrase; but according to the
   observations of Prof. Clarke, it is probably a new species.

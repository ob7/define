[1]bracte

   BRACTE, n. [L. Ainswroth writes, bractea or brattea.]

   In botany, a floral leaf, one of the seven fulcrums or props of plants.
   It differs from other leaves in shape and color, and is generally
   situated on the peduncle, so near the corol, as easily to be mistaken
   for the calyx.

   In the Asiatic Researches, 4.354, this word is anglicized, and written
   bract.

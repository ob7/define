   CRYSTALIZATION, n. [from crystalize.]

   1. The act or process by which the parts of a solid body, separated by
   the intervention of a fluid or by fusion, again coalesce or unite, and
   form a solid body. If the process is slow and undisturbed, the
   particles assume a regular arrangement, each substance taking a
   determinate and regular form, according to its natural laws; but if the
   process is rapid or disturbed, the substance takes an irregular form.
   This process is the effect of refrigeration or evaporation.

   2. The mass or body formed by the process of crystalizing.

[1]betle

   BE'TLE, n. A species of pepper, the leaves of which are chewed by the
   inhabitants of the East Indies. It is a creeping or climbing plant like
   the ivy, the leaves somewhat resembling those of the citron. It is
   planted by a tree, or supported by props. In India, betel is taken
   after meals; during a visit, it is offered to friends when they meet,
   and when they separate; in short, nothing is to be done without betel.
   To correct the bitterness of the leaves, a little areca is wrapped in
   them with the chinam, a kind of burnt lime made of shells.

   1. A natural elevation of land, or a mass of earth rising above the
   common level of the surrounding land; an eminence. A hill is less than
   a mountain, but of no definite magnitude, and is sometimes applied to a
   mountain. Jerusalem is seated on two hills. Rome stood on seven hills.

   2. A cluster of plants, and the earth raised about them; as a hill of
   maiz or potatoes.

      HILL, v.t. To raise earth about plants; to raise a little mass of
           earth. Farmers in New England hill their maiz in July.

   Hilling is generally the third hoeing.

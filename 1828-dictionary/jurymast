[1]jurymast

   JU'RYM`AST, n. A mast erected in a ship to supply the place of one
   carried away in a tempest or an engagement, &c. The most probable
   origin of the word jury, in this compound, is that proposed by Thomson,
   vix. from the Fr. jour, day, quasi, joure, temporary, or from L.
   juvare, to assist.

   TRANSPA'RENCY, n. [See Transparent.] That state or property of a body
   by which it suffers rays of light to pass through it, so that objects
   can be distinctly seen through it; diaphaneity. This is a property of
   glass, water and air, which when clear, admit the free passage of
   light. Transparency is opposed to opakeness.

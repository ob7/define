[1]providence

   PROV'IDENCE, n. [L. providentia.]

   1. The act of providing or preparing for future use or application.

   Providence for war is the best prevention of it. [Now little used.]

   2. Foresight; timely care; particularly, active foresight, or foresight
   accompanied with the procurement of what is necessary for future use,
   or with suitable preparation. How many of the troubles and perplexities
   of life proceed from want of providence!

   3. In theology, the care and superintendence which God exercises over
   his creatures. He that acknowledges a creation and denies a providence,
   involves himself in a palpable contradiction; for the same power which
   caused a thing to exist is necessary to continue its existence. Some
   persons admit a general providence,but deny a particular providence,
   not considering that a general providence consists of particulars. A
   belief in divine providence, is a source of great consolation to good
   men. By divine providence is often understood God himself.

   4. Prudence in the management of one's concerns or in private economy.

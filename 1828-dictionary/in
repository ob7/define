[1]in

   IN, a prefix, L. in, is used in composition as a particle of negation,
   like the English un, of which it seems to be a dialectical orthography;
   or it denotes within, into, or among, as in inbred, incase; or it
   serves only to augment or render emphatical the sense of the word to
   which it is prefixed, as in inclose, increase.

   In, before l, is changed into il, as in illusion; and before r, into
   ir, as in irregular; and into im, before a labial, as in imbitter,
   immaterial, impatient.

   IN, prep. [L. in.] In denotes present or inclosed, surrounded by
   limits; as in a house; in a fort; in a city. It denotes a state of
   being mixed, as sugar in tea; or combined, as carbonic acid in coal, or
   latent heat in air. It denotes present in any state; as in sickness or
   health. It denotes present in time; as in that hour or day. The uses of
   in, however, cannot, in all cases, be defined by equivalent words,
   except by explaining the phrase in which it is used; as in deed; in
   fact; in essence; in quality; in reason; in courage; in spirits, &c. A
   man in spirits or good courage, denotes one who possesses at the time
   spirits or courage; in reason is equivalent to with reason; one in ten
   denotes one of that number, and we say also one of ten, and one out of
   ten.

   In the name, is used in phrases of invoking, swearing, declaring,
   praying, &c. In prayer, it denotes by virtue of, or for the sake of. In
   the name of the people, denotes on their behalf or part; in their
   stead, or for their sake.

       In, in many cases, is equivalent to on. This use of the word is
    frequent in the Scriptures; as, let fowls multiply in the earth. This
    use is more frequent in England than in America. We generally use on,
                           in all similar phrases.

   In signifies by or through. In thee shall all nations be blessed. I am
   glorified in them.

   In that, is sometimes equivalent to because.

   Some things they do in that they are men; some things in that they are
   men misled and blinded with error.

     In these and similar phrases, that is an antecedent, substitute, or
       pronoun relating to the subsequent part of the sentence, or the
   subsequent clause. God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we
    were yet sinners, Christ died for us. That is, in the fact stated in
         the latter clause, for which that is the substitute. Rom.5.

   In as much, seeing; seeing that; this being the fact. I will ride for
   health, inasmuch as I am infirm.

   In is often used without the noun to which it properly belongs. I care
   not who is in, or who is out, that is, in office, or out of office.
   Come in, that is, into the house or other place. Who has or will come
   in, that is, into office. A vessel has come in, that is, into port, or
   has arrived.

   To be or keep in with, to be close or near.

   Keep the ship in with the land.

   TIM'BER, n. [L. domus, a house; Gr. the body.]

   1. That sort of wood which is proper for building or for tools,
   utensils, furniture, carriages, fences, ships and the like. We apply
   the word to standing trees which are suitable for the uses above
   mentioned, as a forest contains excellent timber; or to the beams,
   rafters, scantling, boards, planks, &c. hewed or sawed from such trees.
   Of all the species of trees useful as timber, in our climate, the white
   oak and the white pine hold the first place in importance.

   2. The body or stem of a tree.

   3. The materials; in irony.

   Such dispositions--are the fittest timber to make politics of.

   4. A single piece or squared stick of wood for building, or already
   framed.

   Many of the timbers were decayed.

   5. In ships, a timber is a rib or curving piece of wood, branching
   outward from the keel in a vertical direction. One timber is composed
   of several pieces united in one frame.

            TIM'BER, v.t. To furnish with timber. [See Timbered.]

               TIM'BER, v.i. To light on a tree. [Not in use.]

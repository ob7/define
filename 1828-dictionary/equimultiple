   EQUIMUL'TIPLE, a. [L. oequus and multiplico or multiplex.]

   Multiplied by the same number or quantity.

   EQUIMUL'TIPLE, n. In arithmetic and geometry, a number multiplied by
   the same number or quantity. Hence equimultiples are always in the same
   ratio to each other, as the simple numbers or quantities before
   multiplication. If 6 and 9 are multiplied by 4, the multiples, 24 and
   36, will be to each other as 6 to 9.

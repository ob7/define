   SUB'STANCE, n. [L. substantia, substo; sub and sto, to stand.]

   1. In a general sense, being; something existing by itself; that which
   really is or exists; equally applicable to matter or spirit. Thus the
   soul of man is called an immaterial substance, a cogitative substance,
   a substance endued with thought. We say, a stone is a hard substance,
   tallow is a soft substance.

   2. That which supports accidents.

   That which subsists by itself is called substance; that which subsists
   in and by another, is called a mode or manner of being.

   3. The essential part; the main or material part. In this epitome, we
   have the substance of the whole book.

   This edition is the same in substance with the Latin.

   4. Something real, not imaginary; something solid, not empty.

   Heroic virtue did his actions guide,

   And he the substance, not th' appearance chose.

   5. Body; corporeal nature or matter.

   The qualities of plants are more various than those of animal
   substances.

   6. Goods; estate; means of living. Job's substance was seven thousand
   sheep, three thousand camels, &c. Job 1.

   We are--exhausting our substance, but not for our own interest.

[1]lesser

   LESS'ER, a. [This word is a corruption; but too well established to be
   discarded.]

   Less; smaller. Authors always write the Lesser Asia.

   By the same reason, may a man in a state of nature, punish the lesser
   breaches of that law.

   God made the lesser light to rule the night. Gen. 1.

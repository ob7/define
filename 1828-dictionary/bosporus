[1]bosporus

   BOS'PORUS, n. [Gr. an ox, and a passage.]

   A narrow sea or a strait, between two seas or between a sea and a lake,
   so called, it is supposed, as being an ox-passage, a strait over which
   an ox may swim. So our northern ancestors called a strait, a sound,
   that is, a swim. The term Bosporus has been particularly applied to the
   strait between the Propontis and the Euxine, called the Thracian
   Bosporus; and to the strait of Caffa, called the Cimmerian Bosporus,
   which connects the Palus Maeotis or sea of Azof, with the Euxine.

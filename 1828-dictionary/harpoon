   HARPOON', n. [Gr. to seize with the claws; probably L. rapio, by
   transposition of letters.]

   A harping-iron; a spear or javelin, used to strike whales for killing
   them. It consists of a long shank, with a broad flat triangular head,
   sharpened at both edges for penetrating the whale with facility. It is
   generally thrown by hand.

   HARPOON', v.t. To strike, catch or kill with a harpoon.

   The beluga is usually caught in nets, but is sometimes harpooned.

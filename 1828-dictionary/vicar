   VIC'AR, n. [L. vicarius, from vicis, a turn, or its root.]

   1. In a general sense, a person deputed or authorized to perform the
   functions of another; a substitute in office. The pope pretends to be
   vicar of Jesus Christ on earth. He has under him a grand vicar, who is
   a cardinal, and whose jurisdiction extends over all priests, regular
   and secular.

   2. In the canon law, the priest of a parish, the predial tithes of
   which are impropriated or appropriated, that is, belong to a chapter or
   religious house, or to a layman, who receives them, and only allows the
   vicar the smaller tithes or a salary.

   Apostolical vicars, are those who perform the functions of the pope in
   churches or provinces committed to their direction.

   IMAG'INE, v.t. [L. imaginor, from imago, image.]

   1. To form a notion or idea in the mind; to fancy. We can imagine the
   figure of a horse's head united to a human body.

                In this sense, fancy is the more proper word.

   2. To form ideas or representations in the mind, by modifying and
   combining our conceptions.

   3. To contrive in purpose; to scheme; to devise.

   How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? Ps.62.

   IMAG'INE, v.i. To conceive; to have a notion or idea. I cannot imagine
                       how this should have happened.

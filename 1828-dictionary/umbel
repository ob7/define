[1]umbel

   UM'BEL, n. [L. umbella, a screen or fan.]

   In botany, a particular mode of inflorescence or flowering, which
   consists of a number of flower-stalks or rays, nearly equal in length,
   spreading from a common center, their summits forming a level, convex,
   or even globose surface, more rarely a concave one, as in the carrot.
   it is simple or compound; in the latter, each peduncle bears another
   little umbel, umbellet or umbellicle.

   Umbel is sometimes called a rundle, from its roundness.

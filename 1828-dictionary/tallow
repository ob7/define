[1]tallow

   TAL'LOW, n. A sort of animal fat, particularly that which is obtained
   from animals of the sheep and ox kinds. We speak of the tallow of an ox
   or cow, or of sheep. This substance grows chiefly about the kidneys and
   on the intestines. The fat of swine we never call tallow, but lard or
   suet. I see in English books, mention is made of the tallow of hogs,
   [See Cyclopedia, article Tallow;] but in America I never heard the word
   thus applied. It may be applied to the fat of goats and deer. The fat
   of bears we call bear's grease. Tallow is applied to various uses, but
   chiefly to the manufacture of candles.

   TAL'LOW, v.t. To grease or smear with tallow.

   1. To fatten; to cause to have a large quantity of tallow; as, to
   tallow sheep.

   DISCORD, n. [L.]

   1. Disagreement among persons or things. Between persons, difference of
   opinions; variance; opposition; contention; strife; any disagreement
   which produces angry passions, contest, disputes, litigation or war.
   Discord may exist between families, parties and nations.

   2. Disagreement; want of order; a clashing.

   All discord, harmony not understood.

   3. In music, disagreement of sounds; dissonance; a union of sounds
   which is inharmonious, grating and disagreeable to the ear; or an
   interval whose extremes do not coalesce. Thus the second and the
   seventh, when sounded together, make a discord. The term discord is
   applied to each of the two sounds which form the dissonance, and to the
   interval; but more properly to the mixed sound of dissonant tones. It
   is opposed to concord and harmony.

     DISCORD, v.i. To disagree; to jar; to clash; not to suit; not to be
                          coincident. [Not in use.]

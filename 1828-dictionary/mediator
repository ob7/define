[1]mediator

   MEDIA'TOR, n. One that interposes between parties at variance for the
   purpose of reconciling them.

   1. By way of eminence, Christ is the mediator, the divine intercessor
   through whom sinners may be reconciled to an offended God. Tim.2.

   Christ is a mediator by nature, as partaking of both natures divine and
   human; and mediator by office, as transacting matters between God and
   man.

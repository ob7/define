   LEARN, v.t. lern.

   1. To gain knowledge of; to acquire knowledge or ideas of something
   before unknown. We learn the use of letters, the meaning of words and
   the principles of science. We learn things by instruction, by study,
   and by experience and observation. It is much easier to learn what is
   right, than to unlearn what is wrong.

   Now learn a parable of the fig tree. Matt. 24.

   2. To acquire skill in any thing; to gain by practice a faculty of
   performing; as, to learn to play on a flute or an organ.

   The chief art of learning is to attempt but little at a time.

   3. To teach; to communicate the knowledge of something before unknown.

   Hast thou not learned me how to make perfumes?

   [This use of learn, is found in respectable writers, but is now deemed
   inelegant as well as improper.

                              LEARN, v.i. lern.

   1. To gain or receive knowledge; to receive instruction; to take
   pattern; with of.

   Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly - Matt.
   11.

   2. To receive information or intelligence.

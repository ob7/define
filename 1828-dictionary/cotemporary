[1]cotemporary

   COTEMPORARY, a. [L., time.] Living or being at the same time; as
   cotemporary authors. Josephus was cotemporary with Vespasian.

   COTEMPORARY, a. [L., time.] One who lives at the same time with
   another. [I consider this word as preferable to contemporary, as being
   more easily pronounced.]

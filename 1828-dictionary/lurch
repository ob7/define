[1]lurch

   LURCH, n. [This is the same word radically as lurk. The primary sense
   is to run, start, leap or frisk about, as a man or beast that flies
   from one tree or other object to another to conceal himself. Hence we
   see the peculiar applicability of this word in seamen's language.]

   In seamen's language, a sudden roll of a ship. A lee-lurch is a sudden
   roll to the leeward, as when a heavy sea strikes the ship on the
   weather side.

   To leave in the lurch, to leave in a difficult situation, or in
   embarrassment; to leave in a forlorn state or without help.

                                 LURCH, v.i.

   1. To roll or pass suddenly to one side, as a ship in a heavy sea.

   2. To withdraw to one side, or to a private place; to lie in ambush or
   in secret; to lie close. [For this, lurk is now used.]

   3. To shift; to play tricks.

   I am fain to shuffle, to hedge and to lurch.

                                 LURCH, v.t.

   1. To defeat; to disappoint, that is, to evade; as, to lurch the
   expectation. [Little used.]

   2. To steal; to filch; to pilfer. [Little used.]

      LURCH, v.t. [L. lurco, a glutton.] To swallow or eat greedily; to
                             devour. [Not used.]

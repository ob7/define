   CORN, n. [G., L. See Grain.]

   1. A single seed of certain plants, as wheat, rye, barley and maiz; a
   grain. In this sense, it has a plural; as, three barley corns make an
   inch. It is generally applied to edible seeds, which, when ripe, are
   hard.

   2. The seeds of certain plants in general, in bulk or quantity; as,
   corn is dear or scarce. In this sense, the word comprehends all the
   kinds of grain which constitute the food of men and horses. In Great
   Britain, corn is generally applied to wheat, rye, oats and barley. In
   the United States, it has the same general sense, but by custom, it is
   appropriated to maiz. We are accustomed to say, the crop of wheat is
   good, but the corn is bad; it is a good year for wheat and rye, but bad
   for corn. In this sense, corn has no plural.

   3. The plants which produce corn, when growing in the field; the stalks
   and ears, or the stalks, ears and seeds, after reaping and before
   thrashing. We say, a field of corn, a sheaf or a shock of corn, a load
   of corn. The plants or stalks are included in the terms corn, until the
   seed is separated from the ears.

   4. In surgery, a hard excrescence, or induration of the skin, on the
   toes or some part of the feet, occasioned by the pressure of the shoes;
   so called from its hardness and resemblance to a corn.

   5. A small hard particle. [See Grain.]

                                 CORN, v.t.

   1. To preserve and season with salt in grains; to sprinkle with salt;
   as, to corn beef.

   2. To granulate; to form into small grains.

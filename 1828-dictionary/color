   COLOR, n.

   1. In physics, a property inherent in light, which, by a difference in
   the rays and the laws of refraction, or some other cause, gives to
   bodies particular appearances to the eye. The principal colors are red,
   orange, yellow, green blue, indigo and violet. White is not properly a
   color; as a white body reflects the rays of light without separating
   them. Black bodies, on the contrary, absorb all the rays, or nearly
   all, and therefore black is no distinct color. But in common discourse,
   white and black are denominated colors; and all the colors admit of
   many shades of difference.

   2. Appearance of a body to the eye, or a quality of sensation, caused
   by the rays of light; hue; dye; as the color of gold, or of indigo.

   3. A red color; the freshness or appearance of blood in the face.

   My cheeks no longer did their color boast.

   4. Appearance to the mind; as, prejudice puts a false color upon
   objects.

   5. Superficial cover; palliation; that which serves to give an
   appearance of right; as, their sin admitted no color or excuse.

   6. External appearance; false show; pretense; guise.

   Under the color of commending him,

   I have access my own love to prefer.

   7. Kind; species; character; complexion.

   Boys and women are, for the most part, cattle of this color.

   8. That which is used for coloring; paint; as red lead, ocher,
   orpiment, cinnabar, or vermilion, &c.

   9. Colors, with a plural termination, in the military art, a flag,
   ensign or standard, borne in an army or fleet. [See Flag.]

   10. In law, color in pleading is when the defendant in assize or
   trespass, gives to the plaintiff a color or appearance of title, by
   stating his title specially; thus removing the cause from the jury to
   the court.

   Water-colors are such as are used in painting with gum-water or size,
   without being mixed with oil.

                                 COLOR, v.t.

   1. To change or alter the external appearance of a body or substance;
   to dye; to tinge; to paint; to stain; as, to color cloth. Generally, to

   BRAG, v.i. [Eng. to brag.]

   To boast; to display one's actions, merits or advantages
   ostentatiously; to tell boastful stories; followed by of; as, to brag
   of a good horse, or of a feat.

   To brag on is vulgar; indeed the word itself is become low, and is not
   to be used in elegant composition.

   BRAG, n. A boast, or boasting; ostentatious verbal display of one's
   deeds, or advantages; the thing boasted.

   Spenser has used this word as an adverb for proudly.

   COVERT-WAY, n. In fortification, a space of ground level with the
   field, on the edge of the ditch, three or four fathoms broad, ranging
   quite round the half moons or other works, towards the country. It has
   a parapet raised on a level, together with its banquets and glacis. It
   is called also the corridor, and sometimes the counterscarp, because it
   is on the edge of the scarp.

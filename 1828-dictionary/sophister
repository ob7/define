[1]sophister

   SOPH'ISTER, n. [supra.]

   1. A disputant fallaciously subtil; an artful but insidious logician;
   as an atheistical sophister. Not all the subtil objection of sophisters
   and rabbies against the gospel, so much prejudiced the reception of it,
   as the reproach of those crimes with which they aspersed the assemblies
   of Christians.

   2. A professor of philosophy; a sophist.

    SOPH'ISTER, v.t. To maintain by a fallacious argument. [Not in use.]

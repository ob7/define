[1]pulse

   PULSE, n. puls. [L. pulsus, from pello, to drive.]

   1. In animals, the beating or throbbing of the heart and arteries;more
   particularly, the sudden dilatation of an artery, caused by the
   projectile force of the blood, which is perceptible to the touch. Hence
   we say, to feel the pulse. The pulse is frequent or rare, quick or
   slow, equal or unequal, regular or intermitting, hard or soft, strong
   or weak, &c. The pulses of an adult in health, are little more than one
   pulse to a second; in certain fevers, the number is increased to 90,
   100, or even to 140 in a minute.

   2. The stroke with which a medium is affected by the motion of light,
   sound, &c.; oscillation; vibration.

   Sir Isaac Newton demonstrates that the velocities of the pulses of an
   elastic fluid medium are in a ratio compounded of half the ratio of the
   elastic force directly, and half the ratio of the density inversely.

   To feel one's pulse, metaphorically, to sound one's opinion; to try or
                             to know one's mind.

            PULSE, v.i. To beat, as the arteries. [Little used.]

       PULSE, v.t. [L. pulso.] To drive, as the pulse. [Little used.]

   PULSE, n. [L. pulsus, beaten out, as seeds; Heb. a bean, to separate.]
   Leguminous plants or their seeds; the plants whose pericarp is a legume
                         or pod, as beans, peas, &c.

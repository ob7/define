   FRIEND'SHIP, n. frend'ship.

   1. An attachment to a person, proceeding from intimate acquaintance,
   and a reciprocation of kind offices, or from a favorable opinion of the
   amiable and respectable qualities of his mind. Friendship differs from
   benevolence, which is good will to mankind in general, and from that
   love which springs from animal appetite. True friendship is a noble and
   virtuous attachment, springing from a pure source, a respect for worth
   or amiable qualities. False friendship may subsist between bad men, as
   between thieves and pirates. This is a temporary attachment springing
   from interest, and may change in a moment to enmity and rancor.

   There can be no friendship without confidence, and no confidence
   without integrity.

   There is little friendship in the world.

   The first law of friendship is sincerity.

   2. Mutual attachment; intimacy.

   If not in friendship, live at least in peace.

   3. Favor; personal kindness.

   His friendships, still a few confined, were always of the middling
   kind.

   4. Friendly aid; help; assistance.

   5. Conformity; affinity; correspondence; aptness to unite.

   We know those colors which have a friendship with each other.

   [Not common and hardly legitimate.]

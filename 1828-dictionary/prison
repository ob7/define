   PRISON, n. priz'n. [L. prendo.]

   1. In a general sense, any place of confinement or involuntary
   restraint; but appropriately, a public building for the confinement or
   safe custody of debtors and criminals committed by process of law; a
   jail. Originally, a prison, as Lord Coke observes, was only a place of
   safe custody; but it is now employed as a place of punishment. We have
   state-prisons, for the confinement of criminals by way of punishment.

   2. Any place of confinement or restraint.

   The tyrant Aeolus,

   With power imperial curbs the struggling winds,

   And sounding tempests in dark prisons binds.

   3. In Scripture, a low, obscure, afflicted condition. Eccles.4.

   4. The cave where David was confined. Ps.142.

   5. A state of spiritual bondage. Is.42.

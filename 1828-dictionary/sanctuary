   SANC'TUARY, n. [L. sanctuarium, from sanctus, sacred.]

   1. A sacred place; particularly among the Israelites, the most retired
   part of the temple at Jerusalem, called the Holy of Holies, in which
   was kept the ark of the covenant, and into which no person was
   permitted to enter except the high priest, and that only once a year to
   intercede for the people. The same name was given to the most sacred
   part of the tabernacle. Lev. 4.

                                   Heb. 9.

   2. The temple at Jerusalem. 2Chron. 20.

   3. A house consecrated to the worship of God; a place where divine
   service is performed. Ps. 73.

   Hence sanctuary is used for a church.

   4. In catholic churches, that part of a church where the altar is
   placed, encompassed with a balustrade.

   5. A place of protection; a sacred asylum. Hence a sanctuary-man is one
   that resorts to a sanctuary for protection.

   6. Shelter; protection.

   Some relics of painting took sanctuary under ground.

   IMPOSS'IBLE, a. [L. impossibilis; in and possibilis, from possum, to be
   able.]

   1. That cannot be. It is impossible that two and two should make five,
   or that a circle and a square make five, or that a circle and a square
   should be the same thing, or that a thing should be, and not be at the
   same time.

   2. Impracticable; not feasible; that cannot be done.

   With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.
   Matt.19.

   Without faith it is impossible to please God. Heb.11.

    There are two kinds of impossibilities; physical and moral. That is a
   physical impossibility, which is contrary to the law of nature. A thing
     is said to be morally impossible, when in itself it is possible,but
        attended with difficulties or circumstances which give it the
       appearance of being impossible. [See Possible, Practicable and
                               Impracticable.]

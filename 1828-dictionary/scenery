[1]scenery

   SCE'NERY, n. The appearance of a place, or of the various objects
   presented to view; or the various objects themselves as seen together.
   Thus we may say, the scenery of the landscape presented to the view
   from mount Holyoke, in Hampshire county, Massachusetts, is highly
   picturesque, and exceeded only by the scenery of Boston and its
   vicinity, as seen from the State house.

   Never need an American look beyond his own country for the sublime and
   beautiful of natural scenery.

   2. The representation of the place in which an action is performed.

   3. The disposition and consecution of the scenes of a play.

   4. The paintings representing the scenery of a play.

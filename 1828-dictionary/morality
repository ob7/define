[1]morality

   MORAL'ITY, n. The doctrine or system of moral duties, or the duties of
   men in their social character; ethics.

   The system of morality to be gathered from the writings of ancient
   sages, falls very short of that delivered in the gospel.

   1. The practice of the moral duties; virtue. We often admire the
   politeness of men whose morality we question.

   2. The quality of an action which renders it good; the conformity of an
   act to the divine law, or to the principles of rectitude. This
   conformity implies that the act must be performed by a free agent, and
   from a motive of obedience to the divine will. This is the strict
   theological and scriptural sense of morality. But we often apply the
   word to actions which accord with justice and human laws, without
   reference to the motives form which they proceed.

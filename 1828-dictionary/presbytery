   PRES'BYTERY, n. A body of elders in the christian church.

   Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy,
   with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. 1 Tim.4.

   1. In ecclesiastical government, a judicatory consisting of all the
   pastors of churches within a certain district, and one ruling elder, a
   layman, from each parish, commissioned to represent the parish in
   conjunction with the minister. This body receives appeals from the
   kirk-session, and appeals from the presbytery may be carried to the
   provincial synod.

   The presbytery of the churches in the United States is composed in a
   manner nearly similar.

   2. The presbyterian religion.

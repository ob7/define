[1]repentance

   REPENT'ANCE, n.

   1. Sorrow for any thing done or said; the pain or grief which a person
   experiences in consequence of the injury or inconvenience produced by
   his own conduct.

   2. In theology, the pain, regret or affliction which a person feels on
   account of his past conduct, because it exposes him to punishment. This
   sorrow proceeding merely from the fear of punishment, is called legal
   repentance, as being excited by the terrors of legal penalties, and it
   may exist without an amendment of life.

   3. Real penitence; sorrow or deep contrition for sin, as an offense and
   dishonor to God, a violation of his holy law, and the basest
   ingratitude towards a Being of infinite benevolence. This is called
   evangelical repentance, and is accompanied and followed by amendment of
   life.

   Repentance is a change of mind, or a conversion from sin to God.

   Godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation. 2Cor. 7. Matt. 3.

   Repentance is the relinquishment of any practice, from conviction that
   it has offended God.

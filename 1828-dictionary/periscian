[1]periscian

   PERIS'CIAN, n. [Gr. around, and shadow.] An inhabitant of a frigid zone
   or within a polar circle, whose shadow moves round, and in the course
   of the day falls in every point of compass. The Greek word periscii, in
   the plural, is generally used in geographies; but the English word is
   preferable.

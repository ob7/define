[1]scuffle

   SCUF'FLE, n. [This is a different orthography of shuffle; from shove,
   or its root.]

   1. A contention or trial of strength between two persons, who embrace
   each other's bodies; a struggle with close embrace, to decide which
   shall throw the other; in distinction from from wrestling, which is a
   trial of strength and dexterity at arm's lenght. Among our common
   people, it is not unusual for two persons to commence a contest by
   wrestling, and at last close in, as it is called, and decide the
   contest by a scuffle.

   2. A confused contest; a tumultuous struggle for victory or
   superiority; a fight.

   The dog leaps upon the serpent and tears it to pieces; but in the
   scuffle, the cradle happened to be overturned. L' Estrange.

   SCUF'FLE, v.i.

   1. To strive or struggle with close embrace, as two men or boys,

   2. To strive or contend tumultuously, as small parties.

   A gallant man prefers to fight to great disadvantages in the field, in
   an orderly way, rather than to scuffle with an undisciplined rabble. K.
   Charles.

   STUPEFY, v.t. [L.]

   1. To make stupid; to make dull; to blunt the faculty of perception or
   understanding; to deprive of sensibility. It is a great sin to attempt
   to stupefy the conscience.

   The fumes of passion intoxicate his discerning faculties, as the fumes
   of drink stupefy the brain.

   2. To deprive of material motion.

   It is not malleable nor fluent, but stupefied. [Not in use.]

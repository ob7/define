[1]overplus

   O'VERPLUS, n. [over and L. plus, more.]

   Surplus; that which remains after a supply, or beyond a quantity
   proposed. Take what is wanted and return the overplus.

   It would look like a fable to report that this gentleman gives away all
   which is the overplus of a great fortune.

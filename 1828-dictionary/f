[1]f

   F, the sixth letter of the English Alphabet., is a labial articulation,
   formed by placing the upper teeth on the under lip, and accompanied
   with an emission of breath. Its kindred letter is v, which is chiefly
   distinguished from f by being more vocal, or accompanied with more
   sound, as may be perceived by pronouncing ef, ev. This letter may be
   derived from the Oriental vau. The Latins received the letter from the
   Eolians in Greece, who wrote it in the form of a double g, F,; whence
   it has been called most absurdly digamma. It corresponds in power to
   the Greek phi, and its proper name is ef.

   As a Latin numeral, it signifies 40, and with a dash over the top,
   forty thousand.

   In the civil law, two of these letters together ff, signify the
   pandects.

   In English criminal law, this letter is branded on felons, when
   admitted to the benefit of clergy.

   In medical prescriptions, F stands for fiat, let it be made; F.S.A.
   fiat secundum artem.

   F stands also for Fellow; F.R.S. Fellow of the Royal Society.

   F or fa, in music, is the fourth note rising in this order in the
   gamut, ut, re, mi, fa. It denotes also one of the Greek keys in music,
   destined for the base.

   F in English has one uniform sound, as in father, after.

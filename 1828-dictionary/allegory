[1]allegory

   AL'LEGORY, n. [Gr. other, to speak, a forum, an oration.]

   A figurative sentence or discourse, in which the principal subject is
   described by another subject resembling it in its properties and
   circumstances. The principal subject is thus kept out of view, and we
   are left to collect the intentions of the writer or speaker, by the
   resemblance of the secondary to the primary subject. Allegory is in
   words that hieroglyphics are in painting. We have a fine example of an
   allegory in the eightieth Psalm, in which God's chosen people are
   represented by a vineyard. The distinction in scripture between a
   parable and an allegory, is said to be that a parable is a supposed
   history, and an allegory, a figurative description of real facts. An
   allegory is called a continued metaphor. The following line in Virgil
   is an example of an allegory.

   Claudite jam rivos, pueri, sat prata biberunt.

   Stop the currents, young men, the meadows have drank sufficiently; that
   is let your music cease, our ears have been sufficiently delighted.

[1]narrow

   NARROW, a. I suspect this word and near to be contracted by the loss of
   g, nig, narrow, strait; nigiaw, to narrow; for the D. has naauw,
   narrow, close, G. with a prefix. In this case, the word belongs to the
   root of nigh; to approach.

   1. Of little breadth; not wide or broad; having little distance from
   side to side; as a narrow board; a narrow street; a narrow sea; a
   narrow hem or border. It is only or chiefly applied to the surface of
   flat or level bodies.

   2. Of little extent; very limited; as a narrow space or compass.

   3. Covetous; not liberal or bountiful; as a narrow heart.

   4. Contracted; of confined views or sentiments; very limited.

   The greatest understanding is narrow.

   In this sense and the former, it is often prefixed to mind or soul, &
   c. ; as narrow-minded; narrow-souled; narrow-hearted.

   5. Near; within a small distance.

   6. Close; near; accurate; scrutinizing; as a narrow search; narrow
   inspection.

   7. Near; barely sufficient to avoid evil; as a narrow escape.

    NARROW, n. A strait; a narrow passage through a mountain, or a narrow
    channel of water between one sea or lake and another; a sound. It is

[1]ratio

   RA'TIO, n. ra'sho. [L. from ratus, reor, to think or suppose, to set,
   confirm or establish. Reor is contracted from redor or retor, and
   primarily signifies to throw, to thrust, hence to speak, to set in the
   mind, to think, like L. suppono; and setting gives the sense of a fixed
   rate or rule. See Reason.]

   Proportion, or the relation of homogeneous things which determines the
   quantity of one from the quantity of another, without the intervention
   of a third.

   The relation which one quantity has to another of the same kind, as
   expressed by the quotient of the one divided by the other. Thus the
   ratio of 4 to 2 is 4/2, or 2; and the ratio of 5 to 6 is 5/6. This is
   geometrical ratio, which is that signified when the term is used
   without distinction; but arithmetical ratio is the difference between
   two quantities. Thus the arithmetical ratio of 2 to 6 is 4.

   Ratio respects magnitudes of the same kind only. One line may be
   compared with another line, but a line cannot be compared with a
   superficies, and hence between a line and a superficies there can be no
   ratio.

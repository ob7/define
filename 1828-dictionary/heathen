   HE'ATHEN, n. [Gr. from heath, that is, one who lives in the country or
   woods, as pagan from pagus, a village.]

   1. A pagan; a Gentile; one who worships idols, or is unacquainted with
   the true God. In the Scriptures, the word seems to comprehend all
   nations except the Jews or Israelites, as they were all strangers to
   the true religion, and all addicted to idolatry. The word may now be
   applied perhaps to all nations, except to Christians and Mohammedans.

        Heathen, without the plural termination, is used plurally or
               collectively, for Gentiles or heathen nations.

   Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance.
   Ps.2.

     Heathen, however, has a plural, expressing two or more individuals.

   2. A rude, illiterate, barbarous person.

              HE'ATHEN, a. Gentile, pagan; as a heathen author.

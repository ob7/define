   SOLU'TION, n. [L. solutio, from solvo, to loosen, melt, dissolve. See
   Solve.]

   1. The act of separating the parts of any body; disruption; breach.

   2. The operation or process of dissolving or melting in a fluid; as the
   solution of sugar or salt. [Note. This word is not used in chimistry or
   mineralogy for the dissolution or melting of bodies by the heat of
   fire.] The term solution is appiled to a very extensive class of
   phenomena. When a solid disappears in a liquid, if the compound
   exhibits perfect transparency, we have an example of solution. The word
   is applied both to the act of combination and to the result of the
   process. Thus common salt disappears in water, that is its solution
   takes place, and the liquid obtain ed is called a solution of salt in
   water. Solution is the result of attraction or affinity between. the
   fluid and the solid. This affinity continues to operate to a certain
   point, where it is overbalanced bly the cohesion of the solid; it then
   ceases the fluid issaid to be saturated, the point where the operation
   ceases is called saturation, and the fluid is called a saturated
   solution. Solution is a true chimical union. Mixture is a mere
   mechanicall union of bodies.

   3. Resolution; explanation; the act of explaning or removing difficulty
   or doubt; as the solution of a doubt in casuistry.

   4. Release; deliverance; discharge.

   5. In algebra and geometry, the answering of a question, or the
   resolving of a problem proposed.

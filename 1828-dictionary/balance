   1. A pair of scales, for weighing commodities. It consists of a beam or
   lever suspended exactly in the middle, with a scale or basin hung to
   each extremity, of precisely equal weight.

   The Roman balance, our steel-yard, consists of a lever or beam, movable
       on a center, and suspended near one of its extremities. Hence,

   2. One of the simple powers in mechanics, used for determining the
   equality or difference of weight in heavy bodies,and consequently their
   masses or quantity of matter.

   3. Figuratively, an impartial state of the mind, in deliberating; or a
   just estimate of the reasons and arguments on

      both sides of a question, which gives to each its due weight, or

                                     15

                            force and importance.

   4. As balance signifies equal weight, or equality, it is by custom used
   for the weight or sum necessary to make two unequal weights or sums
   equal; that which is necessary to bring them to a balance or equipoise.
   Hence, in accounts, balance is the difference of two sums; as upon an
   adjustment of accounts, a balance was found against A, in favor of B.
   Hence, to pay a balance, is to pay the difference and make the two
   accounts equal.

   5. Balance of trade is an equal exportation of domestic productions,
   and importation of foreign. But, usually, the term is applied to the
   difference between the amount or value of the commodities exported and
   imported. Hence the common expression, the balance of trade is against
   or in favor of a country.

   "balance of power."

   7. Equipoise, or an equal state of the passions.

     The assay balance is one which is used in docimastic operations, to
                   determine the weight of minute bodies.

    BAL'ANCE, v.t. To adjust the weights in the scales of a balance so as
                    to bring them to an equipoise. Hence,

   2. To weigh reasons; to compare, by estimating the relative force,

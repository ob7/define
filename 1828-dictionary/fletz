   FLETZ, a. In geology, the fletz formations, so called, consist of rocks
   which lie immediately over the transition rocks. These formations are
   so called because the rocks usually appear in beds more nearly
   horizontal than the transition class. These formations consist of
   sandstone, limestone, gypsum, calamine, chalk, coal and trap. They
   contain abundance of petrifactions, both of animal and vegetable
   origin.

   CANTHARIS or plu. CANTHARIDES, n. Spanish flies; a species of Meloe.
   This fly is nine or ten lines in length, of a shining green color,
   mixed with azure, and has a nauseous smell. It feeds upon the leaves of
   trees and shrubs, preferring the ash. These flies, when bruised, are
   universally used as a vesicatory, or blistering plaster. The largest
   come from Italy, but the best from Spain.

   AP'AGOGY, n. [Gr. from, to draw aside, of from and to drive.]

   1. In logic abduction; a kind of argument, wherein the greater extreme
   is evidently contained in the medium, but the medium not so evidently
   in the lesser extreme, as not to require further proof. Thus, "All whom
   God absolves are free from sin; but God absolves all who are in Christ;
   therefore all who are in Christ are free from sin." The first
   proposition is evident; but the second may require further proof, as
   that God received full satisfaction for sin, by the suffering of
   Christ.

   2. In mathematics, a progress or passage from one proposition to
   another, when the first, having been demonstrated, is employed in
   proving others.

   3. In the Athenian law, the carrying a criminal, taken in the fact, to
   a magistrate.

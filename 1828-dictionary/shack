[1]shack

   SHACK, n. In ancient customs of England, a liberty of witer pasturage.
   In Norfolk and Suffolk, the lord of the manot has a shack, that is,
   liberty of feeding his sheep at pleasure on his tenants' lands during
   the dix winter months. In Norfolk, shack extends to the common for
   hogs, in all men's grounds, from harvest to seed time; whence to go
   a-shack, is to feed at large.

   In New England, shack is used in a somewhat similar sense for mast or
   the food of swine, and for feeding at large or in the forest, [for we
   have no manors,] and I have heard a shiftless fellow, a vagabond,
   called a shack.

   SHACK, v.i.

   1. To shed, as corn at harvest. [Local.]

   2. To feed in stubble, or upon the waste corn of the field. [Local.]

[1]nation

   NATION, n. [to be born]

   1. A body of people inhabiting the same country, or united under the
   same sovereign or government; as the English nation; the French nation.
   It often happens that many nations are subject to one government; in
   which case, the word nation usually denotes a body of people speaking
   the same language, or a body that has formerly been under a distinct
   government, but has been conquered, or incorporated with a larger
   nation. Thus the empire of Russia comprehends many nations, as did
   formerly the Roman and Persian empires. Nation, as its etymology
   imports, originally denoted a family or race of men descended from a
   common progenitor, like tribe, but by emigration, conquest and
   intermixture of men of different families, this distinction is in most
   countries lost.

   2. A great number, by way of emphasis.

   Amplitude, in astronomy, is an arch of the horizon intercepted between
   the east and west point, and the center of the sun or star at its
   rising or setting. At the rising of a star, the amplitude is eastern or
   ortive; at the setting, it is western, occiduous, or occasive. It is
   also northern or southern, when north or south of the equator.

   Amplitude of the range, in projectiles, is the horizontal line
   subtending the path of a body thrown, or the line which measures the
   distance it has moved.

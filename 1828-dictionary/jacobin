[1]jacobin

   JAC'OBIN, n. [So named from the place of meeting, which was the
   monastery of the monks called Jacobines.]

   The Jacobins, in France, during the late revolution, were a society of
   violent revolutionists, who held secret meetings in which measures were
   concerted to direct the proceedings of the National Assembly. Hence, a
   Jacobin is the member of a club, or other person, who opposes
   government in a secret and unlawful manner or by violent means; a
   turbulent demagogue.

[1]her

   HER, pronounced hur, an adjective, or pronominal adjective of the third
   person. [L. suus.]

   1. Belonging to a female; as her face; her head.

   2. It is used before neuter nouns in personification.

   Wisdom's ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.
   Prov.3.

       Her is also used as a pronoun or substitute for a female in the
                objective case, after a verb or preposition.

   She gave also to her husband with her, and he did eat. Gen.3.

    Hers is primarily the objective or genitive case, denoting something
       that belongs to a female. But it stands as a substitute in the
                        nominative or objective case.

   And what his fortune wanted, hers could mend.

     Here hers stands for her fortune, but it must be considered as the
     nominative to could mend. I will take back my own book and give you
                  hers. Here hers is the object after give.

   EXCEPT', v.t. [L. excipio; ex and capio, to take. See Caption,
   Capture.]

   1. To take or leave out of any number specified; to exclude; as, of the
   thirty persons present and concerned in a riot, we must except two.

   2. To take or leave out any particular or particulars, from a general
   description.

   When he saith, all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is
   excepted who did put all things under him. 1 Cor.14.

    EXCEPT', v.i. To object; to make an objection or objections; usually
   followed by to; sometimes by against. I except to a witness, or to his
            testimony, on account of his interest or partiality.

     EXCEPT', pp. Contracted from excepted. Taken out; not included. All
    were involved in this affair, except one; that is, one excepted, the
     case absolute or independent clause. Except ye repent, ye shall all
     likewise perish; that is, except this fact, that ye repent, or this
   fact being excepted, removed, taken away, ye shall all likewise perish.
   Or except may be considered as the imperative mode. Except, thou or ye,
   this fact, ye shall all likewise perish. Hence except is equivalent to
                   without, unless, and denotes exclusion.

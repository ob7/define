[1]tole

   TOLE, v.t. To draw or cause to follow by presenting something pleasing
   or desirable to view; to allure by some bait. Thus our farmers tole
   sheep and make them follow, by holding to them a measure of corn or
   some portion of fodder. In New England, it is applied only to the
   alluring of beasts. Locke has applied it to men.

   plan, to be presented to the eye.

   visible lines, marks, colors, &c.; as the description of a country, or
   of Solomons temple.

   containing such representation; a representation of names, nature of
   properties, that gives to another a view of the thing. Homer abounds

   description. Hence,

   6. The persons having the qualities expressed; a class of persons to
   whom a description is applicable, or who are in a similar condition.

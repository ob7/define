   SEV'ERANCE, n. Separation; the act of dividing or disuniting. The
   sevrance of a jointure is make by destroying the unity of interest.
   Thus when there are two joint-tenants for life, and the inheritance is
   purchased by or descends upon either, it is a servrance.

   So also when two persons are joined in a writ, and one is nonsuited; in
   this case sevrance is permitted, and the other plantif may proceed in
   the suit. So also in assize, when two or more disseizees appear upon
   the writ, and not the other, sevrance is permitted.

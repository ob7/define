   ELF, n. plu. elves.

   1. A wandering spirit; a fairy; a hobgoblin; an imaginary being which
   our rude ancestors supposed to inhabit unfrequented places, and in
   various ways to affect mankind. Hence in Scottish, elf-shot is an
   elf-arrow; an arrow-head of flint, supposed to be shot by elfs; and it
   signifies also a disease supposed to be produced by the agency of
   spirits.

   Every elf, and fairy sprite,

   Hope as light as bird from brier.

   2. An evil spirit; a devil.

   3. A diminutive person.

   ELF, v.t. To entangle hair in so intricate a manner, that it cannot be
           disentangled. This work was formerly ascribed to elves.

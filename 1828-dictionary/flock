   to wool or hair, we write it lock. See Flake.]

   birds on the wing, a flight; as a flock of wild-geese; a flock of
   ducks; a flock of blackbirds. in the United States, flocks of
   wild-pigeons sometimes darken the air.

   3. A body or crowd of people. [little used. Gr. a troop.]

   4. A lock of wool or hair. Hence, a flockbed.

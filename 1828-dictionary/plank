   PLANK, n. A broad piece of sawed timber, differing from a board only in
   being thicker. In America, broad pieces of sawed timber which are not
   more than an inch or an inch and a quarter thick, are called boards;
   like pieces from an inch and a half to three or four inches thick, are
   called planks. Sometimes pieces more than four inches thick are called
   planks.

   PLANK, v.t. To cover or lay with planks; as, to plank a floor or a
   ship.

   RESI'DE, v.i. s as z. [L. resideo, resido; re and sedeo, to sit, to
   settle.]

   1. to dwell permanently or for a length of time; to have a settled
   abode for a time. the peculiar uses of this word are to be noticed.
   When the word is appliced to the natives of a state, or others who
   dwell in it as permanent citizens, we use it only with reference to the
   part of a city or country in which a man dwells. We do not say
   generally that Englishmen reside in England, but a particular citizen
   resides in London or York, or at such a house in such a street, in the
   Strand, &c.

   When the word is applied to strangers or travelers, we do not say, a
   man resides in an inn for a night, but he resided in London or Oxford a
   month, or a year; or part of his life. A man lodges, stays, remains,
   abides, for a day or very short time, but reside implies a longer time,
   though not definite.

   2. To sink to the bottom of liquors; to settle. Obs.

   [In this sense, subside is now used.]

[1]which

   WHICH, pron. relative or substitute. [I have not found this word in any
   other language. I think it may be from the root of quick. See What and
   Wight.]

   1. A word called a relative or pronoun relative, because it relates to
   another word or thing, usually to some word that precedes it in the
   sentence. I call it also a substitute, as it supplies the place of a
   noun, or of an adjective, or of a sentence or clause. 1. The garden
   which I cultivate, that is , the garden, which garden I cultivate. 2.
   We are bound to obey all the divine commands, which we cannot do
   without divine aid. Here which represents the words, obey the divine
   commands. 3. You declared him to be innocent, which he is not. Here
   which stands for innocent. In the foregoing uses, which is not used int
   eh masculine gender, that is, it does not in modern usage represent a
   person.

   2. Which is much used in asking questions, for the purpose of obtaining
   the designation of a particular person or thing by the answer, and in
   this use, it is of the masculine as well as of the neuter gender. There
   are two or three things to be done; which shall I do first? Which man
   is it?

   Which of you convinceth me of sin? John 8.

   For which of those works do ye stone me? John 10.

   3. That which. Take which you will, that is, take any one of the whole.

   The which, by the which. The use of the before which, is obsolete.

   SHIP'MENT, n.

   1. The act of putting any thing on board of another ship or vessel;
   embarkation; as, he engaged in the shipment of coal for London.

   2. The goods or things shipped, or put on board of another ship or
   vessel. We say, the merchants have made large shipments to the United
   States.

   The question is whether the share of M in the shipment is exempted from
   the condemnation by reason of his nuetral domicil. J. Story.

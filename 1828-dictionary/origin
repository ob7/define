   OR'IGIN, n. [L. origo.]

   1. The first existence or beginning of any thing; as the origin of
   Rome. In history it is necessary, if practicable, to trace all events
   to their origin.

   2. Fountain; source; cause; that from which any thing primarily
   proceeds; that which gives existence or beginning. The apostasy is
   believed to have been the origin of moral evil. The origin of many of
   our customs is lost in antiquity. Nations, like individuals, are
   ambitious to trace their descent from an honorable origin.

   WAR, n. [G., to perplex, embroil, disturb. The primary sense of the
   root is to strive, struggle, urge, drive, or to turn, to twist.]

   1. A contest between nations or states, carried on by force, either for
   defense, or for revenging insults and redressing wrongs, for the
   extension of commerce or acquisition of territory, or for obtaining and
   establishing the superiority and dominion of one over the other. These
   objects are accomplished by the slaughter or capture of troops, and the
   capture and destruction of ships, towns and property. Among rude
   nations, war is often waged and carried on for plunder. As war is the
   contest of nations or states, it always implies that such contest is
   authorized by the monarch or the sovereign power of the nation. When
   war is commenced by attacking a nation in peace, it si called an
   offensive war, and such attack is aggressive. When war is undertaken to
   repel invasion or the attacks of an enemy, it is called defensive, and
   a defensive war is considered as justifiable. Very few of the wars that
   have desolated nations and deluged the earth with blood, have been
   justifiable. Happy would it be for mankind, if the prevalence of
   Christian principles might ultimately extinguish the spirit of war, and
   if the ambition to be great, might yield to the ambition of being good.

   Preparation for war is sometimes the best security for peace.

   2. In poetical language, instruments of war.

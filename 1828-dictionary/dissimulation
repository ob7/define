[1]dissimulation

   DISSIMULATION, n. [L., to make like; like.] The act of dissembling; a
   hiding under a false appearance; a feigning; false pretension;
   hypocrisy. Dissimulation may be simply concealment of the opinions,
   sentiments or purpose; but it includes also the assuming of a false or
   counterfeit appearance which conceals the real opinions or purpose.
   Dissimulation among statesmen is sometimes regarded as a necessary
   vice, or as no vice at all.

   Let love be without dissimulation. Romans 12.

   CLING, v.i.

   1. To adhere closely; to stick to; to hold fast upon, especially by
   winding round or embracing; as, the tendril of a vine clings to its
   support.

   Two babes of love close clinging to her waist.

   2. To adhere closely; to stick to; as a viscous substance.

   3. To adhere closely and firmly, in interest or affection; as, men of a
   party cling to their leader.

                      CLING, v.t. To dry up, or wither.

   Till famine cling thee.

   In Saxon, clingan is rendered to fade or wither, marcesco, as well as
   to cling. In this sense is used forclingan, pp. forclungen. The radical
   sense then appears to be, to contract or draw together; and drying,
   withering, is expressed by shrinking.

   1. Measure; verse; arrangement of poetical feet, or of long and short
   syllables in verse. Hexameter is a meter of six feet. This word is most
   improperly written metre. How very absurd to write the simple word in
   this manner, but in all its numerous compounds, meter, as in diameter,
   hexameter, thermometer, &c.

   2. A French measure of length, equal to 39 37/100 English inches, the
   standard of linear measure, being the ten millionth part of the
   distance from the equator to the North Pole, as ascertained by actual
   measurement of an arc of the meridian.

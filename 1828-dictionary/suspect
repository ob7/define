   SUSPECT', v.t. [L. suspectus, suspicio; sub and specio, to see or
   view.]

   1. To mistrust; to imagine or have a slight opinion that something
   exists, but without proof and often upon weak evidence or no evidence
   at all. We suspect not only from fear, jealousy or apprehension of
   evil, but in modern usage, we suspect things which give us no
   apprehension.

   Nothing makes a man suspect much, more than to know little.

   From her hand I could suspect no ill.

   2. To imagine to be guilty, but upon slight evidence or without proof.
   When a theft is committed, we are apt to suspect a person who is known
   to have been guilty of stealing; but we often suspect a person who is
   innocent of the crime.

   3. To hold to be uncertain; to doubt; to mistrust; as, to suspect the
   truth of a story.

   4. To hold to be doubtful. The veracity of a historian, and the
   impartiality of a judge, should not be suspected.

   5. To conjecture.

                      SUSPECT', v.t. To imagine guilt.

   If I suspect without cause, why then let me be your jest.

                   SUSPECT', a. Doubtful. [Not much used.]

                           SUSPECT', n. Suspicion.

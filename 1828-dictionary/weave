   in length are called the warp; those which cross them in the direction
   of the breadth, are called the weft or woof.

   2. To unite any thing flexible; as, to weave twigs.

   3. To unite by intermixture or close connection; as a form of religion
   woven into the civil government.

   4. To interpose; to insert.

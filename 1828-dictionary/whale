   WHALE, n. [G., to stir, agitate or rove.] The general name of an order
   of animals inhabiting the ocean, arranged in zoology under the name of
   Cete or Cetacea, and belonging to the class Mammalia in the Linnean
   system. The common whale is of the genus Balaena. It is the largest
   animal of which we have any account, and probably the largest in the
   world. It is sometimes ninety feet in length in the northern seas, and
   in the torrid zone much larger. The whale furnishes us with oil,
   whalebone, &c. [See Cachalot.]

   PIL'LAR, n. [L. pila, a pile, a pillar, a mortar and pestle. The L.
   pila denotes a heap, or things thrown, put or driven together.]

   Literally, a pile or heap; hence,

   1. A kind or irregular column round an insulate, but deviating from the
   proportions of a just column. Pillars are either too massive or too
   slender for regular architecture; they are not restricted to any rules,

   massive work, called also a pier or piedroit, serving to support
   arches. &c.

   2. A supporter; that which sustains or upholds; that on which some
   superstructure rests. Gal.2.

   3. A monument raised to commemorate any person or remarkable
   transaction.

   And Jacob set a pillar on her grave. Gen.35. 2 Sam.18.

   4. Something resembling a pillar; as a pillar of salt. Gen.19.

   So a pillar of a cloud, a pillar of fire. Ex.13.

   5. Foundation; support. Job.9.

   6. In ships, a square or round timber fixed perpendicularly under the
   middle of the beams for supporting the decks.

   7. In the manege, the center of the volta, ring or manege ground,
   around which a horse turns. There are also pillars on the circumference
   or side, placed at certain distances by two and two.

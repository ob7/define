[1]clock

   CLOCK, n.

   1. A machine, consisting of wheels moved by weights, so constructed
   that by a uniform vibration of a pendulum, it measures time, and its
   divisions, hours, minutes and seconds, with great exactness. It
   indicates the hour by the stroke of a small hammer on a bell.

   The phrases, what oclock is it? It is nine oclock, seem to be
   contracted from what of the clock? It is nine of the clock.

   2. A figure or figured work in the ankle of a stocking.

                      CLOCK, v.t. To call. [See Cluck.]

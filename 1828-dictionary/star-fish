   STAR-FISH, n. [star and fish.] The sea star or asterias, a genus of
   marine animals or zoophytes, so named because their body is divided
   into rays, generally five in number, int he center of which and below
   is the mouth, which is the only orifice of the alimentary canal. They
   are covered with a coriaceous skin, armed with points or spines and
   pierced with numerous small holes, arranged in regular series, through
   which pass membranaceous tentacula or feelers, terminated each by a
   little disk or cup, by means of which they execute their progressive
   motions.

   RESEM'BLANCE, n. [See Resemble.]

   1. Likeness; similitude, either of external form or of qualities. We
   observe a resemblance between persons, a resemblance in shape, a
   resemblance in manners, a resemblance in dispositions. Painting and
   poetry bear a great resemblance to each other, as one object of both is
   to please.

   These sensible things which religion hath allowed, are resemblances
   formed according to things spiritual.

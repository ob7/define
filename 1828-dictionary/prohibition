   PROHIBI'TION, n. [L. prohibitio.]

   1. The act of forbidding or interdicting; a declaration to hinder some
   action; interdict.

   The law of God in the ten commandments consists mostly of prohibitions;
   "thou shalt not do such a thing."

   2. In law, a writ of prohibition, is a writ issuing from a superior
   tribunal, directed to the judges of an inferior court, commanding them
   to cease from the prosecution of a suit. By ellipsis, prohibition is
   used for the writ itself.

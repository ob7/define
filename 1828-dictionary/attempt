[1]attempt

   ATTEMPT', v.t. [L. attento, to attempt, of ad and tento, to try; tento
   is from the same root as tendo, to strain; Gr. Hence, the literal sense
   is to strain, urge, stretch.]

   1. To make an effort to effect some object; to make trial or
   experiment; to try; to endeavor; to use exertion for any purpose; as,
   to attempt to sing; to attempt a bold flight.

   2. To attack; to make an effort upon; as, to attempt the enemy's camp.

   This verb is not always followed by an object, and appears to be
   intransitive; but some object is understood, or a verb in the
   infinitive follows in the place of an object; as, he attempted to
   speak.

    ATTEMPT', n. An essay, trial or endeavor; an attack; or an effort to
                                gain a point.

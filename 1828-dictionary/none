[1]none

   NONE, a.

   1. Not one; used of persons or things.

   There is none that doeth good; no, not one. Psalm 14.

   2. Not any; not a part; not the least portion.

   Six days shall ye gather it, but on the seventh day, which is the
   sabbath, in it there shall be none. Exodus 16.

   3. It was formerly used before nouns; as, thou shalt have none
   assurance of thy life. This use is obsolete; we now use no; thou shalt
   have no assurance. This is none other but the house of God; we now say,
   no other.

   4. It is used as a substitute, the noun being omitted. He walketh
   through dry places, seeking rest and finding none; that is, no rest.
   Matthew 7.

   5. In the following phrase, it is used for nothing, or no concern.
   Israel would none of me, that is, Israel would not listen to me at all;
   they would have no concern with me; they utterly rejected my counsels.

   6. As a substitute, none has a plural signification.

   Terms of peace were none vouchsafed.

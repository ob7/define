[1]hone

   HONE, n. A stone of a fine grit, used for sharpening instruments that
   require a fine edge, and particularly for setting razors. [We never, I
   believe, call a hone, a whet-stone. The latter is a stone of coarse
   grit. See the word.]

   HONE, v.t. To rub and sharpen on a bone; as, to hone a razor.

   HONE, v.i. To pine; to long.

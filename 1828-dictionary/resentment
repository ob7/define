[1]resentment

   RESENT'MENT, n.

   1. The excitement of passion which proceeds from a sense of wrong
   offered to ourselves, or to those who are connected with us; anger.
   This word usually expresses less excitement than anger, though it is
   often synonymous with it. It expresses much less than wrath,
   exasperation, and indignation. In this use, resentment is not the sense
   or perception of injury, but the excitement which is the effect of it.

   Can heavenly minds such high resentment show?

   2. Strong perception of good. [Not in use.]

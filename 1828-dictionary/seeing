[1]seeing

   SEE'ING, ppr. [from see.] Perceiving by the eye; knowing;
   understanding; observing; beholding.

   [Note. This participle appears to be used indefinitely, or without
   direct reference to a person or persons. "Wherefore come ye to me,
   seeing ye hate me.?" Gen. 26. That is, since, or the fact being that or
   thus; because that. In this form of phraseology, that is understood or
   implied after seeing; why come ye to me, seeing that, ye hate me? The
   resolution of the phrase or sentence is, ye hate me; that fact being
   seen or known by you, why come ye to me? or why come you to me, ye
   seeing [knowing] that fact which follows, viz. ye hate me. In this
   case, seeing retains its participial character, although its relation
   to the pronoun is somewhat obscured. Originally, seeing, in this use,
   had direct relation to the speaker or to some other person. "Mow I know
   that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not witheld thy son." Gen. 22.
   Here seeing refers to I, or according to the language of syntax, agrees
   or accords with I. I know thou fearest God, for I see thou hast not
   withheld thine only son; I know thou fearest God by seeing, in
   consequence of seeing this fact, thou hast not withheld thine only son.
   But the use of seeing is extended to cases in which it cannot be
   referred to a specifec person or persons, in which cases it expresses
   the notoriety or admission of a fact in general, and is left, like the
   French on, in the phrases on dit, on voit, without application to any
   particular person.]

   1. A pattern; a copy; a mode; that which is proposed to be imitated.
   This word, when applied to material things, is now generally written
   sample, as a sample of cloth; but example is sometimes used.

   2. A pattern, in morals or manners; a copy, or model; that which is
   proposed or is proper to be imitated.

   I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.
   John 13.

   Example is our preceptor before we can reason.

   3. Precedent; a former instance. Buonaparte furnished many examples of
   successful bravery.

   4. Precedent or former instance, in a bad sense, intended for caution.

   Lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief. Heb.4.

   Sodom and Gomorrah--are set forth for an example,suffering the
   vengeance of eternal fire. Jude.7.

   5. A person fit to be proposed for a pattern; one whose conduct is
   worthy of imitation.

   Be thou an example of the believers. 1 Tim 4.

   6. Precedent which disposes to imitation.

   Example has more effect than precept.

   7. Instance serving for illustration of a rule or precept; or a
   particular case or proposition illustrating a general rule, position or
   truth. The principles of trigonometry and the rules of grammar are
   illustrated by examples.

   8. In logic, or rhetoric, the conclusion of one singular point from
   another; an induction of what may happen from what has happened. If
   civil war has produced calamities of a particular kind in one instance,
   it is inferred that it will produce like consequences in other cases.
   This is an example.

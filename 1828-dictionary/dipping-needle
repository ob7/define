   DIPPING-NEEDLE, n. A needle that dips; a magnetic needle which dips or
   inclines to the earth; an instrument which shows the inclination of the
   magnet, at the different points of the earths surface. In the
   equatorial regions, the needle takes a horizontal position; but as we
   recede from the equator towards either pole, it dips or inclines one
   end to the earth, the north end, as we proceed northward, and the south
   end, as we proceed southward, and the farther north or south we
   proceed, the greater is the dip or inclination. This is on the
   supposition that the poles of the earth and the magnetic poles
   coincide, which is not the case. The above statement is strictly true,
   only of the magnetic equator and its poles.

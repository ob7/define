[1]equivocation

   EQUIVOCA'TION, n. Ambiguity of speech; the use of words or expressions
   that are susceptible of a double signification. Hypocrites are often
   guilty of equivocation, and by this means lose the confidence of their
   fellow men. Equivocation is incompatible with the christian character
   and profession.

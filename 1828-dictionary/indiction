   INDIC'TION, n. [Low L. indictio, indico.]

   1. Declaration; proclamation.

   2. In chronology, a cycle of fifteen years, instituted by Constantine
   the Great; originally, a period of taxation. Constantine having reduced
   the time which the Romans were obliged to serve in the army to fifteen
   years, imposed a tax or tribute at the end of that term, to pay the
   troops discharged. This practice introduced the keeping of accounts by
   this period. But, as it is said, in honor of the great victory of
   Constantine over Mezentius, Sep. 24, A.D. 312, by which christianity
   was more effectually established, the council of Nice ordained that
   accounts of years should no longer be kept by Olympiads, but that the
   indiction should be used as the point from which to reckon and date
   years. This was begun Jan.1, A.D. 313.

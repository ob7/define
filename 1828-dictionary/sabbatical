   SABBATICAL, a.

   1. Pertaining to the sabbath.

   2. Resembling the sabbath; enjoying or bringing an intermission of
   labor.

   Sabbatical year, in the Jewish economy, was every seventh year, in
   which the Israelites were commanded to suffer their fields and
   vineyards to rest, or lie without tillage, and the year next following
   every seventh sabbatical year in succession, that is, every fiftieth
   year, was the jubilee, which was also a year of rest to the lands, and
   a year of redemption or release. Lev. 15.

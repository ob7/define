[1]fidelity

   FIDEL'ITY, n. [L. fidelitas, from fides, faith, fido, to trust. See
   Faith.]

   1. Faithfulness; careful and exact observance of duty, or performance
   of obligations. We expect fidelity in a public minister, in an agent or
   trustee, in a domestic servant, in a friend.

   The best security for the fidelity of men, is to make interest coincide
   with duty.

   2. Firm adherence to a person or party with which one is united, or to
   which one is bound; loyalty; as the fidelity of subjects to their king
   or government; the fidelity of a tenant or liege to his lord.

   3. Observance of the marriage covenant; as the fidelity of a husband or
   wife.

   4. Honesty; veracity; adherence to truth; as the fidelity of a witness.

[1]our

   OUR, a.

   1. Pertaining or belonging to us; as our country; our rights; our
   troops.

   2. Ours, which is primarily the possessive case of our, is never used
   as an adjective, but as a substitute for the adjective and the noun to
   which it belongs. Your house is on a plain; ours is on a hill. This is
   good English, but certainly ours must be the nominative to is, or it
   has none.

   Their organs are better disposed than ours for receiving grateful
   impressions from sensible objects.

   Here ours stands in the place of our organs, and cannot, in conformity
   with any rule of construction, be in the possessive case.

   The same thing was done by them in suing in their courts, which is now
   done by us in suing in ours.

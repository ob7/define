[1]coast

   COAST, n.

   1. The exterior line, limit or border of a country, as in Scripture.
   From the river to the uttermost sea shall your coast be. Deut. 11. And
   ships shall come from the coast of Chittim. Numb. 24. Hence the word
   may signify the whole country within certain limits. Ex. 10:4.

   2. The edge or margin of the land next to the sea; the sea-shore. This
   is the more common application of the word; and it seems to be used for
   sea-coast, the border of the sea. Hence it is never used for the bank
   of a river.

   3. A side; applied to objects indefinitely, by Bacon and Newton. This
   is a correct use of the word, but now obsolete.

   4. The country near the sea-shore; as, populous towns along the coast.

   The coast is clear, is a proverbial phrase signifying, the danger is
   over; the enemies have marched off, or left the coast.

                                 COAST, v.i.

   1. To sail near a coast; to sail by or near the shore, or in sight of
   land.

   The ancients coasted only in their navigation.

   2. To sail from port to port in the same country.

                                 COAST, v.t.

   1. To sail by or near to; as, to coast the American shore.

   2. To draw near; to approach; to follow.

   EN'VY, v.t. [L. invideo, in and video, to see against, that is, to look
   with enmity.]

   1. To feel uneasiness, mortification or discontent, at the sight of
   superior excellence, reputation or happiness enjoyed by another; to
   repine at another's prosperity; to fret or grieve one's self at the
   real or supposed superiority of another, and to hate him on that
   account.

   Envy not thou the oppressor. Prov.3.

   Whoever envies another, confesses his superiority.

   2. To grudge; to withhold maliciously.

           To envy at, used by authors formerly, is now obsolete.

   Who would envy at the prosperity of the wicked?

   EN'VY, n. Pain, uneasiness, mortification or discontent excited by the
   sight of another's superiority or success, accompanied with some degree
   of hatred or malignity, and often or usually with a desire or an effort
    to depreciate the person, and with pleasure in seeing him depressed.
    Envy springs from pride, ambition or love, mortified that another has
              obtained what one has a strong desire to possess.

   Envy and admiration are the Scylla and Charybdis of authors.

   All human virtue, to its latest breath,

   Finds envy never conquered, but by death.

   Emulation differs from envy, in not being accompanied with hatred and a
                 desire to depress a more fortunate person.

   Envy, to which th' ignoble mind's a slave,

   Is emulation in the learn'd or brave.

   It is followed by of or to. They did this in envy of Caesar, or in envy
              to his genius. The former seems to be preferable.

   1. Rivalry; competition. [Little used.]

   2. Malice; malignity.

   You turn the good we offer into envy.

   3. Public odium; ill repute; invidiousness.

   To discharge the king of the envy of that opinion.

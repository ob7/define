[1]sweating-sickness

   SWEAT'ING-SICKNESS, n. A febril epidemic disease which prevailed in
   some countries of Europe, but particularly in England, in the 15th and
   16th centuries. Its first appearance was in the army of the earl of
   Richmond, afterward Henry VII on his landing at Milford haven, in 1485.
   The invasion of the disease was sudden, and usually marked by a local
   affection producing the sensation of intense heat, afterwards diffusing
   itself over the whole body, and immediately followed by profuse
   sweating, which continued through the whole course of the disease or
   till death, which often happened in a few hours.

[1]augite

   AU'GITE, n. [Gr. brightness.]

   A mineral called by Hauy, pyroxene; often found in distinct crystals.
   Its secondary forms are all six or eight-sided prisms. Sometimes it
   appears in hemitrope crystals. It has a foliated structure, and is
   harder than hornblend. The varieties are common augite, sahlite,
   fassaite, and cocolite. The omphacite of Werner appears also to be a
   variety; and the common augite, found near the lake Baikal, has been
   called Baikalite.

   Werner divides augite into four sub-species; granular, foliated,
   conchoidal, and common; and there is a variety called slaggy augite.

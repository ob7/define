[1]abound

   ABOUND', v. i. [L. abundo. If this word is from L. unda, a wave, the
   latter has probably lost its first consonant. Abound may naturally be
   deduced from the Celtic. L. fons, a fountain.]

   1. To have or possess in great quantity; to be copiously supplied;
   followed by with or in; as to abound with provisions; to abound in good
   things.

   2. To be in great plenty; to be very prevalent.

   Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound. Rom. v.

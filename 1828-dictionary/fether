[1]fether

   FETH'ER, n.

   1. A plume; a general name of the covering of fowls. The smaller
   fethers are used for the filling of beds; the larger ones, called
   quills, are used for ornaments of the head, for writing pens, &c. The
   fether consists of a shaft or stem, corneous, round, strong and hollow
   at the lower part, and at the upper part, filled with pith. On each
   side of the shaft are the vanes, broad on one side and narrow on the
   other, consisting of thin lamins. The fethers which cover the body are
   called the plumage; the fethers of the wings are adapted to flight.

   2. Kind; nature; species; from the proverbial phrase, "Birds of a
   fether," that is, of the same species. [Unusual.]

   I am not of that feather to shake off my friend, when he most needs me.

   3. An ornament; an empty title.

   4. On a horse, a sort of natural frizzling of the hair, which, in some
   places, rises above the lying hair, and there makes a figure resembling
   the tip of an ear of wheat.

   A fether in the cap, is an honor, or mark of distinction.

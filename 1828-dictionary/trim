   TRIM, a. Firm; compact; tight; snug; being in good order. We say of a
   ship, she is trim, or trim-built; every thing about the man is trim. We
   say of a person, he is trim, when his body is well shaped and firm; and
   we say, his dress is trim, when it sits closely to his body and appears
   tight and snug; and of posture we say, a man or a soldier is trim, when
   he stands erect. It is particularly applicable to soldiers, and in
   Saxon, truma is a troop or body of soldiers.

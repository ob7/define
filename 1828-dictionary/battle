[1]battle

   BAT'TLE, n. [See Beat.] Owen supposes the Welsh batel, to be from tel,
   tight, stretched, compact, and the word primarily to have expressed the
   drawing of the bow. This is probably an error. The first battles of men
   were with clubs, or some weapons used in beating, striking. Hence the
   club of Hercules. And although the moderns use different weapons, still
   a battle is some mode of beating or striking.]

   1. A fight, or encounter between enemies, or opposing armies; an
   engagement. It is usually applied to armies or large bodies of men; but
   in popular language, the word is applied to an encounter between small
   bodies, between individuals, or inferior animals. It is also more
   generally applied to the encounters of land forces than of ships; the
   encounters of the latter being called engagements. But battle is
   applicable to any combat of enemies.

   2. A body of forces, or division of an army.

   The main body, as distinct from the van and rear.

    To give battle, is to attack an enemy; to join battle, is properly to
    meet the attack; but perhaps this distinction is not always observed.

   A pitched battle is one in which the armies are previously drawn up in
               form, with a regular disposition of the forces.

    To turn the battle to the gate, is to fight valiantly, and drive the
         enemy, who hath entered the city, back to the gate. Is.28.

    BAT'TLE, v.i. To join in battle; to contend in fight; sometimes with
                            it; as, to battle it.

                  BAT'TLE, v.t. To cover with armed force.

[1]p

   P is the sixteenth letter of the English Alphabet, and a labial
   articulation formed by a close compression of the anterior part of the
   lips, as in ep. It is convertible into b and f, sometimes into v.

   This letter is found int he oriental languages, from which it was
   received into the Greek and Latin; except however the Arabic, which has
   not this letter, and the Arabians cannot easily pronounce it. In some
   words which we have borrowed from the Greek, p is mute, as in psalm,
   ptisan; but is not silent in English words, unless it may be in
   receipt, and a few irregular words. P aspirated or followed by h,
   represents the Greek, which answers to the English f, as in philosophy.

   As an abbreviation, P. stands for Publius, pondo, &c. P.A. DIG for
   patricia dignitas; P.C. for Patres Conscripti; P.F. for Publius Fabius;
   P.P. for propositum publice; P.R. for populus Romanus; P.R.S. for
   praetoris sententia; P.R.S.P. for praeses provinciae.

   P.M. stands for post meridiem, afternoon.

   As a numeral, P, like G, stands for one hundred, and with a dash over
   it, for four hundred thousand.

   Among physicians, P. Stands for pugil, or the eighth part of a handful;
   P.AE. For partes aequales, equal parts of the ingredients; P.P. for
   pulvis patrum, or the Jesuits bark in powder; and ppt. For praeparatus,
   prepared.

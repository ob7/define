   specifies the time of execution, and usually the time from which they
   are to take effect and operate on the rights of persons. To the date is
   usually added the name of the place where a writing is executed, and
   this is sometimes included in the term date.

   when any thing is to be done; as the date of a battle; the date of
   Cesar's arrival in Britain.

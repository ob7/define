   WAGE, v.t.

   1. To lay; to bet; to throw down as a pledge; to stake; to put at
   hazard on the event of a contest. Thisis the common popular sense of
   the word in New England; as, to wage a dollar; to wage a horse.

   2. To venture; to hazard.

   To wake and wage a danger profitless.

   3. To make; to begin; to carry on; that is, to go forward or advance to
   attack, as in invasion or aggression; used in the phrase, to wage war.
   he waged war with all his enemies.

   He ponderd which of all his sons was fit

   To reign, and wage immortal war with wit.

   4. To set to hire.

   Thou must wage Thy works for wealth. [Not in use.]

   5. To take to hire; to hire for pay; to employ for wages; as eaged
   soldiers. He was well waged and rewarded.

   To wage oness law, to give security to make ones law. The defendent is
   then to swear that he owes nothing to the plaintiff, and eleven
   neighbors, called compurgators, are to avow upon their oaths, that they
   believe in their consciences he has declared the truth. This is called
   wager of law.

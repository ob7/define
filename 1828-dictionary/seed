   SEED, n.

   1. The substance, animal or vegetable, which nature prepares for the
   reproduction and conservation of the species. The seeds of plants are a
   deciduous part, containing the rudiments of a new vegetable. In some
   cases, the seeds costitute the fruit or valuable part of plants, as in
   the case of wheat and other esculent grain; sometimes the seeds are
   inclosed in fruit, as in apples and melons. When applied to animal
   matter, it has no plural.

   2. That from which any thing springs; first principle; original; as the
   seeds of virtue or vice.

   3. Principle of production.

   Praise of great acts he scatters as a seed. Waller.

   4. Progeny; offspring; children; descendants; as the seed of Abraham;
   the seed of David. In this sense, the word is applied to one person, or
   to any number collectively, and admits of the plural form; but rarely
   used in the plural.

   5. Race; generation; birth.

   Of mortal seed they were not held. Waller.

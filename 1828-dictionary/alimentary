   ALIMENT'ARY, a. Pertaining to aliment or food; having the quality of
   nourishing; as, alimentary particles.

   The alimentary canal, in animal bodies, is the great duct or intestine,
   by which aliments are conveyed through the body, and the useless parts
   evacuated.

   Alimentary law, among the Romans, was a law which obliged children to
   support their parents.

   Obligation of aliment, in Scots law, is the natural obligation of
   parents to provide for their children.

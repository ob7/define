[1]will

   WILL, n. [See the Verb.]

   1. That faculty of the mind by which we determine either to do or
   forbear an action; the faculty which is exercised in deciding, among
   two or more objects, which we shall embrace or pursue. The will is
   directed or influenced by the judgment. The understanding or reason
   compares different objects, which operate as motives; the judgment
   determines which is preferable, and the will decides which to pursue.
   In other words, we reason with respect to the value or importance of
   things; we then judge which is to be preferred; and we will to take the
   most valuable. These are but different operations of the mind, soul, or
   intellectual part of man. Great disputes have existed respecting the
   freedom of the will. Will is often quite a different thing from desire.

   A power over a man's subsistence, amounts to a power over his will.

   2. Choice; determination. It is my will to prosecute the trespasser.

   3. Choice; discretion; pleasure.

   Go, then, the guilty at thy will chastise.

   4. Command; direction.

   Our prayers should be according to the will of God.

   5. Disposition; inclination; desire. What is your will, Sir? In this
   phrase, the word may also signify determination, especially when
   addressed to a superior.

   6. Power; arbitrary disposal.

   7. Divine determination; moral purpose or counsel.

   Thy will be done. Lords Prayer.

   8. Testament; the disposition of a mans estate, to take effect after
   his death. Wills are written, or nuncupative, that is, verbal.

   Good will,

   1. Favor; kindness.

   2. Right intention. Philippians 1.

   Ill will, enmity; unfriendliness. It expresses less than malice.

   To have ones will, to obtain what is desired.

   At will. To hold an estate at the will of another, is to enjoy the
   possession at his pleasure, and be liable to be ousted at any time by
   the lessor or proprietor.

   Will with a wisp, Jack with a lantern; ignis fatuus; a luminous
   appearance sometimes seen in the air over moist ground, supposed to
   proceed from hydrogen gas.

     WILL, v.t. [G., L., Gr. The sense is to set, or to set forward, to
           stretch forward. The sense is well expressed by the L.]

   1. To determine; to decide int he mind that something shall be done or
   forborne; implying power to carry the purpose into effect. In this
   manner God wills whatever comes to pass. So in the style of princes; we
   will that execution be done.

   A man that sits still is said to be at liberty, because he can walk if
   he will it.

   6. It is sometimes equivalent to may be. Let the circumstances be what
   they will; that is, any circumstances, of whatever nature.

   7. Will is used as an auxiliary verb, and a sign of the future tense.
   It has different signification in different persons.

   1. I will go, is a present promise to go; and with an emphasis on will,
   it expresses determination.

   2. Thou wilt go, you will go, express foretelling; simply stating an
   event that is to come.

   3. He will go, is also a foretelling. The use of will in the plural, is
   the same. We will, promises; ye will, they will, foretell.

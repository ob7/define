   1. To strengthen; to invigorate; to cheer or enliven.

   2. To strengthen the mind when depressed or enfeebled; to console; to
   give new vigor to the spirits; to cheer, or relieve from depression, or
   trouble.

                                 COMFORT, n.

   1. Relief from pain; ease; rest or moderate pleasure after pain, cold
   or distress or uneasiness of body. The word signifies properly new
   strength, or animation; and relief from pain is often the effect of
   strength. In a popular sense, the word signifies rather negatively the
   absence of pain and the consequent quiet, than positive animation.

   2. Relief from distress of mind; the ease and quiet which is
   experienced when pain, trouble, agitation or affliction ceases. It
   implies also some degree of positive animation of the spirits; or some
   pleasurable sensations derived from hope, and agreeable prospects;
   consolation.

   Let me alone, that I may take comfort a little. Job 10.

   Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. Matt. 9.

   Pious children are the comfort of their aged parents.

   5. In law, support; assistance; countenance; encouragement; as, an
   accessory affords aid or comfort to a felon.

   6. That which gives security from want and furnishes moderate
   enjoyment; as the comforts of life.

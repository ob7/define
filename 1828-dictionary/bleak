   BLEAK, a.

   1. Pale. [But not often used in this sense, in America, as far as my
   observations extend.]

   2. Open; vacant; exposed to a free current of air; as a bleak hill or
   shore. This is the true sense of the word; hence cold and cheerless. A
   bleak wind is not so named merely from its coldness, but from its
   blowing without interruption, on a wide waste;at least this is the
   sense in America. So in Addison. "Her desolation presents us with
   nothing but bleak and barren prospects.'

    BLEAK, n. A small river fish, five or six inches long, so named from
     its whiteness. It belongs to the genus Cyprinus,and is known to the
    Londoners by the name of white bait. It is called also by contraction
                                    blay.

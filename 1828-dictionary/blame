   BLAME, v.t. [The Greeks have the root of this word, to blaspheme.]

   1. To censure; to express disapprobation of; to find fault with;
   opposed to praise or commend, and applicable most properly to persons,
   but applied also to things.

   I withstood him, because he was to be blamed. Gal.2.

   I must blame your conduct; or I must blame you for neglecting business.
   Legitimately, it cannot be followed by of.

   2. To bring reproach upon; to blemish; to injure. [See Blemish.]

   She had blamed her noble blood.

   BLAME, n. Censure; reprehension; imputation of a fault; disapprobation;
      an expression of disapprobation for something deemed to be wrong.

   Let me bear the blame forever. Gen.43.

   1. Fault; crime; sin; that which is deserving of censure or
   disapprobation.

   That we should be holy and without blame before him in love. Eph.i.

   2. Hurt; injury.

   And glancing down his shield, from blame him fairly blest.

   The sense of this word, as used by Spenser, proves that it is a
   derivative from the root of blemish.

      To blame, in the phrase,he is to blame, signifies blamable, to be
                                   blamed.

   Blame is not strictly a charge or accusation of a fault; but it implies
   an opinion in the censuring party, that the person censured is faulty.
    Blame is the act or expression of disapprobation for what is supposed
                                to be wrong.

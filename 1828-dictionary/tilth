   TILTH, n. That which is tilled; tillage ground. [Not in use.]

   1. The state of being tilled or prepared for a crop. We say, land is in
   good tilth,when it is manured, plowed, broken and mellowed for
   receiving the seed. We say also, ground is in bad tilth. When we say,
   land is in tilth, we mean in good condition for the seed; not in
   tilth,in a bad condition.

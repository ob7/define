[1]benefice

   BEN'EFICE, n. [L. beneficium.]

   1. Literally, a benefit, advantage or kindness. But in present usage,
   en ecclesiastical living; a church endowed with a revenue, for the
   maintenance of divine service,or the revenue itself. All church
   preferments are called benefices, except bishoprics, which are called
   dignities. But ordinarily, the term dignity is applied to bishoprics,
   deaneries, arch-deaconries, and prebendaries; and benefice, to
   parsonages, vicarages, and donatives.

   2. In the middle ages, benefice was used for a fee, or an estate in
   lands, granted at first for like only, and held ex mero beneficio of
   the donor. The estate afterwards becoming hereditary, took the
   appellation of feud, and benefice became appropriated to church
   livings.

[1]evening

   E'VENING, n. [See Eve, Even.] The latter part and close of the day, and
   the beginning of darkness or night; properly the decline or fall of the
   day, or of the sun.

   The evening and the morning were the first day. Gen.1.

        The precise time when evening begins, or when it ends, is not
    ascertained by usage. The word often includes a part at least of the
      afternoon, and indeed the whole afternoon; as in the phrase, "The
     morning and evening service of the sabbath." In strictness, evening
   commences at the setting of the sun, and continues during twilight, and
     night commences with total darkness. But in customary language, the
    evening extends to bed-time, whatever that time may be. Hence we say,
            to spend an evening with a friend; an evening visit.

   1. The decline or latter part of life. We say, the evening of life, or
   of one's days.

   2. The decline of any thing; as the evening of glory.

      E'VENING, a. Being at the close of day; as the evening sacrifice.

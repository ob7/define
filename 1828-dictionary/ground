   GROUND, n.

   1. The surface of land or upper part of the earth, without reference to
   the materials which compose it. We apply ground to soil,sand or gravel
   indifferently, but never apply it to the whole mass of the earth or
   globe, nor to any portion of it when removed. We never say a shovel
   full or a load of ground. We say under ground, but not under earth; and
   we speak of the globe as divided into land and water, not into ground
   and water. Yet ground, earth and land are often used synonymously. We
   say, the produce or fruits of the ground, of the earth, or of land. The
   water overflows the low ground, or the low land.

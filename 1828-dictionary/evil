   E'VIL, a. e'vl. [Heb. to be unjust or injurious, to defraud.]

   1. Having bad qualities of a natural kind; mischievous; having
   qualities which tend to injury, or to produce mischief.

   3. Unfortunate; unhappy; producing sorrow, distress, injury or
   calamity; as evil tidings; evil arrows; evil days.

     E'VIL, n. Evil is natural or moral. Natural evil is any thing which
   produces pain, distress, loss or calamity, or which in any way disturbs
   the peace, impairs the happiness, or destroys the perfection of natural
                                   beings.

   Moral evil is any deviation of a moral agent from the rules of conduct
   prescribed to him by God, or by legitimate human authority; or it is
   any violation of the plain principles of justice and rectitude.

    There are also evils called civil, which affect injuriously the peace
    or prosperity of a city or state; and political evils, which injure a
                       nation, in its public capacity.

    All wickedness, all crimes, all violations of law and right are moral
    evils. Diseases are natural evils, but they often proceed from moral
                                   evils.

   2. Misfortune; mischief; injury.

   There shall no evil befall thee. Ps.91.

   A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself. Prov.22.

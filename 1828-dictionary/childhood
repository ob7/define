   CHILDHOOD, n.

   1. The state of a child, or the time in which persons are children,
   including the time from birth to puberty. But in a more restricted
   sense, the state or time from infancy to puberty. Thus we say, infancy,
   childhood, youth and manhood.

   Childhood and youth are vanity. Eccl. 11.

   2. The properties of a child.

   AIR, n. [L. aer; Heb. to shine. The radical sense is to open, expand;
   whence clear; or to flow, to shoot, to radiate.]

   1. The fluid which we breathe. Air is inodorous, invisible, insipid,
   colorless, elastic, possessed of gravity, easily moved, rarefied, and
   condensed.

   Atmospheric air is a compound fluid, consisting of oxygen gas, and
   nitrogen or azote; the proportion of each is stated by chimists
   differently; some experiments making the oxygen a twenty-eighth part of
   a hundred; others, not more than a twenty-third, or something less. The
   latter is probably the true proportion.

   Oxygen gas is called vital air. The body of air surrounding the earth
   is called the atmosphere. The specific gravity of air is to that of
   water, nearly as 1 to 828. Air is necessary to life; being inhaled into
   the lungs, the oxygenous part is separated from the azotic, and it is
   supposed to furnish the body with heat and animation. It is the medium
   of sounds and necessary to combustion.

   2. Air in motion; a light breeze.

   Let vernal airs through trembling osiers play.

   3. Vent; utterance abroad; publication; publicity; as, a story has
   taken air.

   You gave it air before me.

   Wind is used in like manner.

   4. A tune; a short song or piece of music adapted to words; also, the
   peculiar modulation of the notes, which gives music its character; as,
   a soft air. A song or piece of poetry for singing; also, the leading
   part of a tune, or that which is intended to exhibit the greatest
   variety of melody.

   5. The peculiar look, appearance, manner or mien of a person; as, a
   heavy air; the air of youth; a graceful air; a lofty air. It is applied
   to manners or gestures, as well as to features.

   6. Airs, in the plural, is used to denote an affected manner, show of
   pride, haughtiness; as, when it is said of a person, he puts on airs.
   The word is used also to express the artificial motions or carriage of
   a horse.

   7. In painting, that which expresses the life of action; manner;
   gesture; attitude.

   8. Any thing light or uncertain; that is light as air.

   Who builds his hope in air of your fair looks. Obs.

   9. Advice; intelligence; information. Obs.

   10. Different states of air are characterized by different epithets;
   as, good air, foul air, morning air, evening air; and sometimes airs
   may have been used for ill-scent or vapor, but the use is not
   legitimate.

   To take the air, is to go abroad; to walk or ride a little distance.

   To take air, is to be divulged; to be made public.

                                  AIR, v.t.

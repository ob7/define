   SAN'DARACH, n. [L. sandaraca.]

   1. A resin in white tears, more transparent than those of mastic;
   obtained from the juniper tree, in which it occupies the place between
   the bark and the wood. It is used in powder to prevent ink from sinking
   or spreading. This is the substance denoted by the Arabic word, and it
   is also called varnish. For distinction, this is called gum sandarac or
   sandaric.

   The sandarach is obtained from the Thuya articulata, from the Juniperus
   cedrus.

   2. A native fossil; also, a combination of arsenic and sulphur;
   orpiment.

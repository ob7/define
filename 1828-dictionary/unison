[1]unison

   U'NISON, n. [L. unus, one, and sonur, sound.]

   1. In music, an accordance or coincidence of sounds, proceeding from an
   equality in the number of vibrations made in a given time by a sonorous
   body. If two chords of the same matter have equal length, thickness and
   tension, they are said to be in unison, and their sounds will be in
   unison. Sounds of very different qualities and force may be in unison;
   as the sound of a bell may be in unison with a sound of a flute. Unison
   then consists in sameness of degree, or similarity in respect to
   gravity or acuteness, and is applicable to any sound, whether of
   instruments or of the human organs, &c.

   2. A single unvaried note.

   In unison, in agreement; in harmony.

                         U'NISON, a. Sounding alone.

   Sounds intermix'd with voice, choral or unison.

[1]dilatation

   DILATATION, n. The act of expanding; expansion; a spreading or
   extending in all directions; the state of being expanded; opposed to
   contraction. Dilatation differs from extension, as the latter is
   applied to lines and surfaces; the former to bodies that spread, open
   or enlarge in all directions. A line or a plain is extended; a bladder,
   an artery, a balloon is dilated.

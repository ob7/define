   HAIL, n. Masses of ice or frozen vapor, falling from the clouds in
   showers or storms. These masses consist of little spherules united, but
   not all of the same consistence; some being as hard and solid as
   perfect ice; others soft, like frozen snow. Hailstones assume various
   figures; some are round, others angular, others pyramidical, others
   flat, and sometimes they are stellated with six radii, like crystals of
   snow.

   HAIL, v.i. To pour down masses of ice or frozen vapors.

   HAIL, v.t. To pour.

   HAIL, a. [Gr. whole.] Sound; whole; healthy; not impaired by disease;
   as a hail body; hail corn. [In this sense, it is usually written hale.]

   HAIL, an exclamation, or rather a verb in the imperative mode, being
   the adjective hail, used as a verb. Hail, be well; be in health; health

   HAIL, n. A wish of health; a salutation. This word is sometimes used as
                    a noun; as, the angel hail bestowed.

    HAIL, v.t. [L. calo. See Call and Heal.] To call; to call to a person
   at a distance, to arrest his attention. It is properly used in any case
     where the person accosted is distant, but is appropriately used by
   seamen. Hoa or hoi, the ship ahoay, is the usual manner of hailing; to
   which the answer is holloa, or hollo. Then follow the usual questions,
                  whence came ye? where are you bound? &c.

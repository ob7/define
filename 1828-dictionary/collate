[1]collate

   COLLATE, v.t. Literally, to bring or lay together. Hence,

   1. To lay together and compare, by examining the points in which two or
   more things of a similar kind agree or disagree; applied particularly
   to manuscripts and books; as, to collate copies of the Hebrew
   Scriptures.

   2. To confer or bestow a benefice on a clergyman, by a bishop who has
   it in his own gift or patronage; or more strictly, to present and
   institute a clergyman in a benefice, when the same person is both the
   ordinary and the patron; followed by to.

   If the patron neglects to present, the bishop may collate his clerk to
   the church.

   3. To bestow or confer; but now seldom used, except as in the second
   definition.

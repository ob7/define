[1]organize

   OR'GANIZE, v.t.

   1. To form with suitable organs; to construct so that one part may
   cooperate with another.

   Those nobler faculties of the soul organized matter could never
   produce.

   2. To sing in parts; as, to organize the hallelujah.

   3. To distribute into suitable parts and appoint proper officers, that
   the whole may act as one body; as, to organize an army. So we say, to
   organize the house of representatives, which is done by the appointment
   of officers and verification of the powers of the several members. So
   we say, a club, a party or a faction is organized, when it takes a
   systemized form.

   This original and supreme will organizes the government.

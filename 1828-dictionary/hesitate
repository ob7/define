[1]hesitate

   HES'ITATE, v.i. s as z. [L. haesito, haereo, to hang.]

   1. To stop or pause respecting decision or action; to be doubtful as to
   fact, principle or determination; to be in suspense or uncertainty; as,
   he hesitated whether to accept the offer or not. We often hesitate what
   judgment to form.

   It is never transitive, unless by poetic license.

   Just hint a fault, and hesitate dislike.

   2. To stammer; to stop in speaking.

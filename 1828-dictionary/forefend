[1]forefend

   FOREFEND', v.t.

   1. To hinder; to fend off; to avert; to prevent approach; to forbid or
   prohibit.

   2. To defend; to guard; to secure.

   This word, like the L. arceo, is applied to the thing assailing, and to
   the thing assailed. To drive back or resist that which assails, is to
   hinder its approach, to forbid or avert, and this act defends the thing
   threatened or assailed.

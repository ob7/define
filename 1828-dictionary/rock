   ROCK, n. [Gr., L. rupes, from the root of rumpo, to break or burst. If
   this is not the origin of rock, I know not to what root to assign it.]

   1. A large mass of stony matter, usually compounded of two or more
   simple minerals, either bedded in the earth or resting on its surface.
   Sometimes rocks compose the principal part of huge mountains; sometimes
   hugh rocks lie on the surface of the earth, in detached blocks or
   masses. Under this term, mineralogists class all mineral substances,
   coal, gypsum, salt, &c.

   2. In Scripture, figuratively, defense; means of safety; protection;
   strength; asylum.

   The Lord is my rock. 2Sam. 22.

   3. Firmness; a firm or immovable foundation. Ps. 28.

                             Matt. 7. Matt. 16.

   4. A species of vulture or condor.

   5. A fabulous bird in the Eastern tales.

                                  ROCK, n.

   A distaff used in spinning; the staff or frame about which flax is
   arranged, from which the thread is drawn in spinning.

                                 ROCK, v.t.

   1. To move backward and forward, as a body resting on a foundation; as,
   to rock a cradle; to rock a chair; to rock a mountain. It differs from
   shake, as denoting a slower and more uniform motion, or larger
   movements. It differs from swing, which expresses a vibratory motion of
   something suspended.

   A rising earthquake rock'd the ground.

   2. To move backwards and forwards in a cradle, chair, &c.; as, to rock
   a child to sleep.

   3. To lull to quiet.

   Sleep rock thy brain. [Unusual.]

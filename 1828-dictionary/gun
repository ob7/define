   GUN, n. An instrument consisting of a barrel or tube of iron or other
   metal fixed in a stock, from which balls, shot or other deadly weapons
   are discharged by the explosion of gunpowder. The larger species of
   guns are called cannon; and the smaller species are called muskets,
   carbines, fowling pieces, &c. But one species of fire-arms, the pistol,
   is never called a gun.

   GUN, v.i. To shoot.

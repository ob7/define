[1]alms

   'ALMS, 'amz. [Eng. almesse; L. eleemosyna; Gr. to pity.]

   Any thing given gratuitously to relieve the poor, as money, food, or
   clothing, otherwise called charity.

   A lame man was laid daily to ask an alms. Acts. 3.

   Cornelius gave much alms to the people. Acts. 10.

   Tenure by free alms, or frank-almoign, in England, is that by which the
   possessor is bound to pray for the soul of the donor, whether dead or
   alive; a tenure by which most of the ancient monasteries and religious
   houses in England held their lands, as do the parochial clergy, and
   many ecclesiastical and eleemosynary establishments at this day. Land
   thus held was free from all rent or other service.

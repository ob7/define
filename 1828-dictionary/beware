[1]beware

   BEWA'RE, v.i.

   1. Literally, to restrain or guard one's self from. Hence, to regard
   with caution; to restrain one's self from anything that may be
   dangerous, injurious or improper; to avoid; to take care; followed by
   of before the thing that is to be avoided.

   Beware of all, but more beware of man.

   Beware of false prophets; beware of the leaven of the Pharisees; beware
                              of the concision.

   2. To have a special regard to.

   Behold, I send an angel before thee--beware of him, and obey his voice.
   Ex.23.

   [This is unusual and hardly legitimate.]

   This word though here admitted as a verb, from the Saxon,is rarely used
      as a verb in fact; or if a verb, is now never used except in the
   imperative mode It is a compound of be and the Old Eng. ware, now wary.
     Be wary of danger. Hence it cannot be used with did, like a regular
    verb, nor with be, in any of its inflections, he is beware; for this
   would be to use the substantive verb twice before ware and wary, is and
      be. Ben Jonson however has used the word in the third person. He
   bewares to act. But it has no past tense or participle, and therefore,
   if admitted as a verb, it is defective,and used only in the imperative
                        mode, or after an auxiliary.

   We must beware of excess.

   CHIMNEY-CORNER, n.

   1. The corner of a fire-place, or the space between the fire and the
   sides of the fire-place. In the Northern States of America, fire-places
   were formerly made six or eight feet wide, or even more, and a stool
   was placed by the side of the fire, as a seat for children, and this
   often furnished a comfortable situation for idlers. As fuel has become
   scarce, our fire-places are contracted, till, in many or most of our
   dwellings, we have no chimney-corners.

   2. In a more enlarged sense, the fire-side, or a place near the fire.

[1]promiser

   PROM'ISER, n. One who promises; one who engages, assures, stipulates or
   covenants. Fear, says Dryden, is a great promiser. We may say that hope
   is a very liberal promiser.

   The import of a promise, when disputed, is not to be determined by the
   sense of the promiser, nor by the expectations of the promisee.

     [Note. In law language, promisor is used, but without necessity or
                                 advantage.]

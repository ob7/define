   DEPART, v.i.

   1. To go or move from.

   Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire. Matt. 25.

   It is followed by from, or from is implied before the place left.

   I will depart to my own land, that is, I will depart from this place to
   my own land. Num. 10.

   2. To go from; to leave; to desist, as from a practice. Jehu departed
   not from the sins of Jeroboam. Jehoshaphat departed not from the way of
   Asa his father.

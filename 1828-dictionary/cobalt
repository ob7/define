   COBALT, n. A mineral of a reddish gray or grayish white color, very
   brittle, of a fine close grain, compact, but easily reducible to
   powder. It crystalizes in bundles of needles, arranged one over
   another. It is never found in a pure state; but usually as an oxyd, or
   combined with arsenic or its acid, with sulphur, iron, &c. Its ores are
   arranged under the following species, viz. Arsenical cobalt, of a white
   color, passing to steel gray; its texture is granular, and when heated
   it exhales the odor of garlic: gray cobalt, a compound of cobalt,
   arsenic, iron, and sulphur, of a white color, with a tinge of red; its
   structure is foliated, and its crystals have a cube for their primitive
   form; sulphuret of cobalt, compact and massive in its structure: oxyd
   of cobalt, brown or brownish black, generally friable and earthy:
   sulphate and arseniate of cobalt, both of red color, the former soluble
   in water. The impure oxyd of cobalt is called zaffer; but when fused
   with three parts of siliceous sand and an alkaline flux, it is
   converted into a blue glass, called smalt. The great use of cobalt is
   to give a permanent blue color to glass and enamels upon metals,
   porcelain and earthern wares.

   Cobalt-bloom, acicular arseniate of cobalt.

   Cobalt-crust, earthy arseniate of cobalt.

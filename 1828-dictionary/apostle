[1]apostle

   APOS'TLE, n. [L. apostalus; Gr. to send away, to sent.]

   A person deputed to execute some important business; but appropriately,
   a disciple of Christ commissioned to preach the gospel. Twelve persons
   were selected by Christ for this purpose; and Judas, one of the number,
   proving an apostate, his place was supplied by Matthias. Acts 1.

   The title of apostle is applied to Christ himself, Heb. 3. In the
   primitive ages of the church, other ministers were called apostles,
   Rom. 16; as were persons sent to carry alms from one church to another,
   Philip. 2. This title was also given to persons who first planted the
   Christian faith. Thus Dionysius of Corinth is called the apostle of
   France; and the Jesuit Missionaries are called apostles.

   Among the Jews, the title was given to officers who were sent into
   distant provinces, as visitors or commissioners, to see the laws
   observed.

   Apostle, in the Greek liturgy, is a book contained the epistles of St.
   Paul, printed in the order in which they are to be read in churches,
   through the year.

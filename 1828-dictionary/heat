   HEAT, n. [L. aestus, for haestus, or caestus.]

   1. Heat, as a cause of sensation, that is, the matter of heat, is
   considered to be a subtil fluid, contained in a greater or less degree
   in all bodies. In modern chimistry, it is called caloric. It expands
   all bodies in different proportions, and is the cause of fluidity and
   evaporation. A certain degree of it is also essential to animal and
   vegetable life. Heat is latent, when so combined with other matter as
   not to be perceptible. It is sensible, when it is evolved and
   perceptible.

   2. Heat, as a sensation, is the effect produced on the sentient organs
   of animals, by the passage of caloric, disengaged from surrounding
   bodies, to the organs. When we touch or approach a hot body, the
   caloric or heat passes from that body to our organs of feeling, and
   gives the sensation of heat. On the contrary, when we touch a cold
   body, the caloric passes from the hand to that body, and causes a
   sensation of cold.

   Note. This theory of heat seems not to be fully settled.

   3. Hot air; hot weather; as the heat of the tropical climates.

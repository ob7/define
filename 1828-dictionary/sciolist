   SCI'OLIST, n. [L. sciolus, a diminutive formed on scio, to know.]

   One who knows little, or who knows many things superficially; a
   smatterer.

   These passages in that book, were enough to humble the presumption of
   our modern sciolists, if their pride were not as great as their
   ignorance.

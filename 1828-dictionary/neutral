   NEUTRAL, a. [L. From neuter.]

   1. Not engaged on either side; not taking an active part with either of
   contending parties. It is policy for a nation to be neutral when other
   nations are at war. Belligerents often obtain supplies from neutral
   states.

   2. Indifferent; having no bias in favor of either side or party.

   3. Indifferent; neither very good nor bad.

   Some things good, and some things ill do seem, And neutral some in her
   fantastic eye.

   Neutral salt, in chimistry, a salt or body composed of two primitive
   saline substances in combination, and possessing the character neither
   of an acid or alkaline salt; or a combination of an acid with any
   substance which destroys its acidity; any salt saturated with an
   alkali, an earth or a metal. But it is more usual to denominate
   neutral, a salt which is united with an alkaline substance, and to cal
   the others earthy or metallic.

   NEUTRAL, n. A person or nation that takes no part in a contest between
                                   others.

   The neutral, as far as his commerce extends, becomes a party in the
   war.

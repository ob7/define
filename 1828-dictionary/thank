   THANK, v.t.

   1. To express gratitude for a favor; to make acknowledgments to one for
   kindness bestowed.

   We are bound to thank God always for you. 2 Thess 1.

   Joab bowed himself and thanked the king. 2 Sam.14.

   2. It is used ironically.

   Weigh the danger with the doubtful bliss,

   And thank yourself, if aught should fall amiss.

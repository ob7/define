[1]krout

   CROUT, KROUT, n. [G., an herb.] Sour crout is made by laying minced or
   chopped cabbage in layers in a barrel, with a handful of salt and
   caraway seeds between the layers; then ramming down the whole, covering
   it, pressing it with a heavy weight, and suffering it to stand, till it
   has gone through fermentation. It is an efficacious preservative
   against scurvy in long voyages.

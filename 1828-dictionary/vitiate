[1]vitiate

   VI'TIATE, v.t. [L. vitio. See vice and Viciate.]

   1. To injure the substance or qualities of a thing, so as to impair or
   spoil its use and value. Thus we say, luxury vitiates the humors of the
   body; evil examples vitiate the morals of youth; language is vitiated
   by foreign idioms.

   This undistinguishing complaisance will vitiate the taste of readers.

   2. To render defective; to destroy; as the validity or binding force of
   an instrument or transaction. Any undue influence exerted on a jury
   vitiates their verdict. Fraud vitiates a contract.

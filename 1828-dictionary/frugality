[1]frugality

   FRUGAL'ITY, n.

   1. Prudent economy; good husbandry or housewifery; a sparing use or
   appropriation of money or commodities; a judicious use of any thing to
   be expended or employed; that careful management of money or goods
   which expends nothing unnecessarily, and applies what is used to a
   profitable purpose; that use in which nothing is wasted. It is not
   equivalent to parsimony, the latter being an excess of frugality, and a
   fault. Frugality is always a virtue. Nor is it synonymous with thrift,
   in its proper sense; for thrift is the effect of frugality.

   Without frugality none can become rich, and with it few would be poor.

   2. A prudent and sparing use or appropriation of any thing; as
   frugality of praise.

   ALLA'Y, v.t. [Gr.; L.ligo, to bind; but this may be the same word
   differently applied, that is, to set, to fix, to make fast, to unite.
   Allay and alloy were formerly used indifferently; but I have recognized
   an entire distinction between them, applying alloy to metals.]

   1. To make quiet; to pacify, or appease; as, to allay the tumult of the
   passions, or to allay civil commotions.

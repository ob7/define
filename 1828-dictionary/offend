[1]offend

   OFFEND', v.t. [L. offendo; of and fendo, obs. to strike, hit, meet, or
   thrust against. We use the simple verb in fend, to fend off, to fence.]

   1. To attack; to assail. [Not used.]

   2. To displease; to make angry; to affront. It expresses rather less
   than make angry, and without any modifying word, it is nearly
   synonymous with displease. We are offended by rudeness, incivility and
   harsh language. Children offend their parents by disobedience, and
   parents offend their children by unreasonable austerity or restraint.

   The emperor was grievously offended with them who had kept such
   negligent watch.

   A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city. Prov. 18.

   3. To shock; to wound; as, to offend the conscience.

   4. To pain; to annoy; to injure; as, a strong light offends weak eyes.

   5. To transgress; to violate; as, to offend the laws. But we generally
   use the intransitive verb in this sense, with against; to offend
   against the law.

   6. To disturb, annoy, or cause to fall or stumble.

   Great peace have they that love thy law, and nothing shall offend them.
   Ps. 119.

   7. To draw to evil, or hinder in obedience; to cause to sin or neglect
   duty.

   If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out - if thy right hand offend
   thee, cut it off. Matt. 5.

                                OFFEND', v.i.

   1. To transgress the moral or divine law; to sin; to commit a crime.

   Whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, is
   guilty of all. James 2.

   In many things we offend all. James 3.

   2. To cause dislike or anger.

   I shall offend, either to detain or to give it.

   But this phrase is really elliptical, some person being understood.

   3. To be scandalized; to be stumbled.

   If meat make my brother to offend - 1Cor. 8.

   1. To offend against, to act injuriously or unjustly.

   Nor yet against Caesar have I offended any thing at all. Acts 25.

   2. To transgress; to violate; as, to offend against the laws of
   society, the laws of God, or the rules of civility or propriety.

   We have offended against the Lord already. 2Chron. 28.

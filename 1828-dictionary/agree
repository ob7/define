[1]agree

   AGREE', v.i.[L. gratia. the primary sense is advancing, from the same
   root as L. gradior.]

   1. To be of one mind; to harmonize in opinion.

   In the expediency of the law, all the parties agree.

   2. To live in concord, or without contention; as, parents and children
   agree well together.

   3. To yield assent; to approve or admit; followed by to; as, to agree
   to an offer, or to an opinion.

   4. To settle by stipulation, the minds of parties being agreed, as to
   the terms; as,

   Didst thou not agree with me for a penny a day? Mat. 20

   To agree on articles of partnership

   5. To come to a compromise of differences; to be reconciled.

   Agree with thy adversary quickly. Mat. 5

   6. To come to one opinion or mind; to concur; as, to agree on a place
   of meeting.

   This sense differs not essentially from the fourth, and it often
   implies a resolving to do an act. John 9.

   7. To be consistent; to harmonize; not to contradict, or be repugnant.

   Their witness agreed not together. Mark 24.

   This story agrees with what has been related by others.

   8. To resemble; to be similar; as, the picture does not agree with the
   original.

   9. To suit; to be accommodated or adapted to; as, the same food does
   not agree with every constitution.

   AGREE', v.t. To admit, or come to one mind concerning; as, to agree the
    fact. Also, to reconcile or make friends; to put an end to variance;
     but these senses are unusual and hardly legitimate. Let the parties
      agree the fact, is really elliptical; let them agree on the fact.

   used.]

   1. Upheard. [Not used.]

   2. Designating a quantity whose root cannot be exactly expressed in

   SURD, n. In algebra, a quantity whose root cannot be exactly expressed
    in numbers. Thus 2 is a surd number, because there is no number which
               multiplied into itself, will exactly produce 2.

[1]era

   E'RA, n. [L. oera. The origin of the term is not obvious.]

   1. In chronology, a fixed point of time, from which any number of years
   is begun to be counted; as the Christian Era. It differs from epoch in
   this; era is a point of time fixed by some nation or denomination of
   men; epoch is a point fixed by historians and chronologists. The
   christian era began at the epoch of the birth of Christ.

   2. A succession of years proceeding from a fixed point, or comprehended
   between two fixed points. The era of the Seleucides ended with the
   reign of Antiochus.

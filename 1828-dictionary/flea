   FLEA, n. [See Flee and Fly.]

   An insect of the genus Pulex. It has two eyes and six feet; the feelers
   are like threads; the rostrum is inflected, setaceous, and armed with a
   string. The flea is remarkable for its agility, leaping to a surprising
   distance, and its bite is very troublesome.

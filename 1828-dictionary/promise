   PROM'ISE, n. [L. promissum, from promitto, to send before or forward;
   pro and mitto, to send.]

   1. In a general sense, a declaration, written or verbal, made by one
   person to another, which binds the person who makes it, either in
   honor, conscience or law, to do or forbear a certain act specified; a
   declaration which gives to the person to whom it is made, a right to
   expect or to claim the performance or forbearance of the act. The
   promise of a visit to my neighbor, gives him a right to expect it, and
   I am bound in honor and civility to perform the promise. Of such a
   promise human laws have no cognizance; but the fulfillment of it is one
   of the minor moralities, which civility, kindness and strict integrity
   require to be observed.

   2. In law, a declaration, verbal or written, made by one person to
   another for a good or valuable consideration, in the nature of a
   covenant, by which the promiser binds himself, and as the case may be,
   his legal representatives, to do or forbear some act; and gives to the
   promisee a legal right to demand and enforce a fulfillment.

   3. A binding declaration of something to be done or given for another's
   benefit; as the promise of a grant of land. A promise may be absolute
   or conditional; lawful or unlawful; express or implied. An absolute
   promise must be fulfilled at all events. The obligation to fulfill a
   conditional promise depends on the performance of the condition. An
   unlawful promise is not binding, because it is void; for it is
   incompatible with a prior paramount obligation of obedience to the
   laws. An express promise, is one expressed in words or writing. An
   implied promise, is one which reason and justice dictate. If I hire a
   man to perform a day's labor, without any declaration that I will pay
   him, the law presumes a promise on my part that I will give him a
   reasonable reward, and will enforce much implied promise.

   4. Hopes; expectation, or that which affords expectation of future
   distinction; as a youth of great promise.

   My native country was full of youthful promise.

   5. That which is promised; fulfillment or grant of what is promised.

   He commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait
   for the promise of the Father. Acts.1.

   6. In Scripture,the promise of God is the declaration or assurance
   which God has given in his word of bestowing blessings on his people.
   Such assurance resting on the perfect justice,power, benevolence and
   immutable veracity of God, cannot fail of performance.

   The Lord is not slack concerning his promises. 2 Pet.3.

      PROM'ISE, v.t. To make a declaration to another, which binds the
   promiser in honor, conscience or law, to do or forbear some act; as, to
   promise a visit to a friend; to promise a cessation of hostilities; to
                        promise the payment of money.

   1. To afford reason to expect; as, the year promises a good harvest.

   2. To make declaration or give assurance of some benefit to be
   conferred; to pledge or engage to bestow.

   The proprietors promised large tracts of land.

    PROM'ISE, v.i. To assure one by a promise or binding declaration. The
                   man promises fair; let us forgive him.

   1. To afford hopes or expectations; to give ground to expect good. The
   youth promises to be an eminent man; the wheat promises to be a good
   crop; the weather promises to be pleasant.

   2. In popular use, this verb sometimes threatens or assures of evil.
   The rogue shall be punished, I promise you.

   Will not the ladies be afraid of the lion?

   --I fear it, I promise you.

   In the latter example, promise is equivalent to declare; "I declare to
   you."

   3. To promise one's self, to be assured or to have strong confidence.

   I dare promise myself you will attest the truth of all I have advanced.

   DUMB, a. Dum.

   1. Mute; silent; not speaking.

   I was dumb with silence; I held my peace. Psalm 34.

   2. Destitute of the power of speech; unable to utter articulate sounds;
   as the dumb brutes. The asylum at Hartford in Connecticut was the first
   institution in America for teaching the deaf and dumb to read and
   write.

   3. Mute; not using or accompanied with speech; as a dumb show; dumb
   signs.

   To strike dumb, is to confound; to astonish; to render silent by
   astonishment; or it may be, to deprive of the power of speech.

                           DUMB, v.t. To silence.

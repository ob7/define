[1]discretion

   DISCRETION, n. [L, a separating. See Discreet.]

   1. Prudence, or knowledge and prudence; that discernment which enables
   a person to judge critically of what is correct and proper, united with
   caution; nice discernment and judgment, directed by circumspection, and
   primarily regarding ones own conduct.

   A good man--will guide his affairs with discretion. Psalm 112.

   My son, keep sound wisdom and discretion. Proverbs 3.

   2. Liberty or power of acting without other control than ones own
   judgment; as, the management of affairs was left to the discretion of
   the prince; he is left to his own discretion. Hence,

   To surrender at discretion, is to surrender without stipulation or
   terms, and commit ones self entirely to the power of the conqueror.

   3. Disjunction; separation. [Not much used.]

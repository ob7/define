   CASE, n.

   1. A covering, box or sheath; that which incloses or contains; as a
   case for knives; a case for books; a watch case; a printers case; a
   pillow case.

   2. The outer part of a building.

   3. A certain quantity; as a case of crown glass.

   4. A building unfurnished.

                                 CASE, v.t.

   1. To cover with a case; to surround with any material that shall
   inclose or defend.

   2. To put in a case or box.

   3. To strip off a case, covering, or the skin.

     CASE, n. Literally, that which falls, comes, or happens; an event.
   Hence, the particular state, condition, or circumstances that befall a
    person, or in which he is placed; as, make the case your own; this is
             the case with my friend; this is his present case.

   2. The state of the body, with respect to health or disease; as a case
   of fever; he is in a consumptive case; his case is desperate.

   To be in good case, is to be fat, and this phrase is customarily
   abridged, to be in case; applied to beasts, but not to men, except in a
   sense rather ludicrous.

   3. A question; a state of facts involving a question for discussion or
   decision; as, the lawyer stated the case.

   4. A cause or suit in court; as, the case was tried at the last term.
   In this sense, case is nearly synonymous with cause, whose primary
   sense is nearly the same.

   5. In grammar, the inflection of nouns, or a change of termination, to
   express a difference of relation in the word to others, or to the thing
   represented. The variation of nouns and adjectives is called
   declension; both case and declension signifying, falling or leaning
   from the first state of the word. Thus, liber is a book; libri, of a
   book; libro, to a book. In other words, case denotes a variation in the
   termination of a noun, to show how the noun acts upon the verb with
   which it is connected, or is acted upon by it, or by an agent. The
   cases, except the nominative, are called oblique cases.

   In case, is a phrase denoting condition or supposition; literally, in
   the event or contingency; if it should so fall out or happen.

   Put the case, suppose the event, or a certain state of things.

   Action on the case, in law, is an action in which the whole cause of
   complaint is set out in the writ.

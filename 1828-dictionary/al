   AL, in Arabic, an adjective or inseparable prefix. Its use is to render
   nouns definite, like the English the; as, alkoran, the koran or the
   book by eminence; alcove, alchimy, alembic, almanac, &c.

   AL, In English, is sometimes a contraction of the Saxon athel, noble or
   illustrious.

   More generally al, in composition is a contraction of ald or alt, old,
   and it is prefixed to many names, as Alburg.

   Al, in the composition of Latin words, is written before l for ad, for
   the ease of pronunciation; as, in allevo, alludo, for ad levo, ad ludo.

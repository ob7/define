   TRADE, n. [L. tracto, to handle, use, treat.]

   1. The act or business of exchanging commodities by barter; or the
   business of buying and selling for money; commerce; traffic; barter.
   Trade comprehends every species of exchange or dealing, either in the
   produce of land, in manufactures, in bills or money. It is however
   chiefly used to denote the barter or purchase and sale of goods, wares
   and merchandise, either by wholesale or retail. Trade is either
   foreign, or domestic or inland. Foreign trade consists in the
   exportation and importation of goods, or the exchange of the
   commodities of different countries. Domestic or home trade is the
   exchange or buying and selling of goods within a country. Trade is also
   by the wholesale, that is, by the package or in large quantities, or it
   is by retail, or in small parcels.

   The carrying trade is that of transporting commodities from one country
                            to another by water.

   2. The business which a person has learned and which he carries on for
   procuring subsistence or for profit; occupation; particularly,
   mechanical employment; distinguished from the liberal arts and learned
   professions, and from agriculture. Thus we speak of the trade of a
   smith, of a carpenter or mason. But we never say, the trade of a farmer
   or of a lawyer or physician.

   3. Business pursued; occupation; in contempt; as, piracy is their
   trade.

   Hunting their sport, and plund'ring was their trade.

   4. Instruments of any occupation.

   The shepherd bears

   His house and household goods, his trade of war.

   5. Employment not manual; habitual exercise.

   6. Custom; habit; standing practice.

   Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.

   7. Men engaged in the same occupation. Thus booksellers speak of the
   customs of the trade.

     TRADE, v.i. To barter, or to buy and sell; to deal in the exchange,
   purchase or sale of goods, wares and merchandise, or any thing else; to
    traffic; to carry on commerce as a business. Thus American merchants
   trade with the English at London and at Liverpool; they trade with the
    French at Havre and Bordeaux, and they trade with Canada. The country
     shopkeepers trade with London merchants. Our banks are permitted to
                         trade in bills of exchange.

   1. To buy and sell or exchange property, in a single instance. Thus we
   say, man treats with another for his farm, but cannot trade with him. A
   traded with B for a horse or a number of sheep.

   2. To act merely for money.

   How did you dare

   To trade and traffic with Macbeth?

   3. To have a trade wind.

   They on the trading flood ply tow'rd the pole. [Unusual.]

                TRADE, v.t. To sell or exchange in commerce.

   They traded the persons of men. Ezek. 27.

   [This, I apprehend, must be a mistake; at least it is not to be
   vindicated as a legitimate use of the verb.]

   SEDU'CER, n.

   1. One that seduces; one that by temptation or arts, entices another to
   depart from the path of rectitude and duty; pre-eminently, one that by
   flattery, promises or falsehood, persuades a female to surrender her
   chastity. The seducer of a female is little less criminal than the
   murderer.

   2. That which leads astray; that which entices to evil.

   He whose firm faith no reason could remove,

   Will mest before that soft seducer, love. Dryden.

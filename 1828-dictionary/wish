   WISH, v.i. [G.]

   1. To have a desire, or strong desire, either for what is or is not
   supposed to be obtainable. It usually expresses less than long; but
   sometimes it denotes to long or wise earnestly. We often wise for what
   is not obtainable.

   This is as good an argument as an antiquary could wish for.

   They have more than heart could wish. Psalm 73.

   I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper. 3 John 2.

   They cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day. Acts
   27.

   2. To be disposed or inclined; as, to wish well to anothers affairs.

   3. It sometimes partakes of hope or fear. I wish the event may prove
   fortunate, or less calamitous than we apprehend.

                                 WISH, v.t.

   1. To desire. I wish your prosperity.

   Let them be driven backward and put to shame, that wish me evil. Psalm
   40.

   2. To long for; to desire eagerly or ardently. It has this sense when
   expressed with emphasis.

   3. To recommend by wishing.

   I would not wish them to a fairer death.

   4. To imprecate; as, to wish curses on an enemy.

   5. To ask; to express desire.

                                  WISH, n.

   1. Desire; sometimes, eager desire. Job 33.

   2. Desire expressed.

   Blisterd be thy tongue for such a wish.

   3. Thing desired. He has his wish.

   The difference between wish and desire seems to be, that desire is
   directed to what is obtainable, and a wish may be directed to what is
   obtainable or not.

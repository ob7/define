   EM'PIRE, n. [L. imperium; See Emperor.]

   1. Supreme power in governing; supreme dominion; sovereignty; imperial
   power. No nation can rightfully claim the empire of the ocean.

   2. The territory, region or countries under the jurisdiction and
   dominion of an emperor. An empire is usually a territory of greater
   extent than a kingdom, which may be and often is a territory of small
   extent. Thus we say, the Russian empire; the Austrian empire; the
   sovereigns of which are denominated emperors. The British dominions are
   called an empire, and since the union of Ireland, the parliament is
   denominated the imperial parliament, but the sovereign is called king.
   By custom in Europe, the empire means the German empire; and in
   juridical acts, it is called the holy Roman empire. Hence, we say, the
   diet of the empire; the circles of the empire; &c. But the German
   empire no longer exists; the states of Germany now form a confederacy.

   3. Supreme control; governing influence; rule; sway; as the empire of
   reason, or of truth.

   4. Any region, land or water, over which dominion is extended; as the
   empire of the sea.

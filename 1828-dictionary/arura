[1]arura

   ARU'RA, n. [Gr.] Literally, as authors suppose, a plowed field.
   According to Herodotus, and Suidas, the arura of Egypt, was a piece of
   ground fifty feet square. Others make it a square of 100 cubits; others
   of 100 feet. The Grecian aroura was a square measure of half the
   plethron. [See Aroura.]

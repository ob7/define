   SAVIOR, n. savyur. One that saves or preserves; but properly applied
   only to Jesus Christ, the Redeemer, who has opened the way to
   everlasting salvation by his obedience and death, and who is therefore
   called the Savior, by way of distinction, the Savior of men, the Savior
   of the world. General Washington may be called the saver, but not the
   savior of his country.

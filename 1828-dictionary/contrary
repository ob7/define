[1]contrary

   CONTRARY, a. [L., against.]

   1. Opposite; adverse; moving against or in an opposite direction; as
   contrary winds.

   2. Opposite; contradictory; not merely different, but inconsistent or
   repugnant.

   The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh;
   and these are contrary, the one to the other. Galatians 5.

   This adjective, in many phrases, is to be treated grammatically as an
   adverb, or as an adjective referring to a sentence or affirmation; as,
   this happened contrary to my expectations. The word here really belongs
   to the affirmation or fact declared, this happened; for contrary does
   not, like an adverb, express the manner of happening, but that the fact
   itself was contrary to my expectation. According, agreeable, pursuant,
   antecedent, prior, anterior, &c., are often used in the like manner.

                                CONTRARY, n.

   1. A thing that is contrary or of opposite qualities.

   No contraries hold more antipathy, than I and such a knave.

   2. A proposition contrary to another, or a fact contrary to what is
   alledged; as, this is stated to be a fact, but I will endeavor to show
   the contrary.

   On the contrary, in opposition; on the other side.

   To the contrary, to an opposite purpose, or fact.

   They did it, not for want of instruction to the contrary.

   He said it was just, but I told him to the contrary.

                   CONTRARY, v.t. To contradict or oppose.

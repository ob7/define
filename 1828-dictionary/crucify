   a cross or gibbet, sometimes anciently, by fastening a criminal to a
   tree, with cords.

   But they cried, crucify him, crucify him. Luke 23.

   2. In scriptural language, to subdue; to mortify; to destroy the power
   or ruling influence of.

   They that are Christs have crucified the flesh, with the affections and
   lusts. Galatians 5.

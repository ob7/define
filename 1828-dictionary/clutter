[1]clutter

   CLUTTER, n.

   1. A heap or assemblage of things lying in confusion; a word of
   domestic application.

   He saw what a clutter there was with huge pots, pans and spits.

   2. Noise; bustle. [This sense seems allied to clatter, but it is not
   the sense of the word in N. England.]

     CLUTTER, v.t. To crowd together in disorder; to fill with things in
           confusion; as, to clutter a room; to clutter the house.

           CLUTTER, v.i. To make a bustle, or fill with confusion.

   [The English lexicographers explain this word by noise and bustle; but
   probably by mistake.]

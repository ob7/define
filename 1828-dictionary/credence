   CREDENCE, n. [See Creed.]

   1. Belief; credit; reliance of the mind on evidence of facts derived
   from other sources than personal knowledge, as from the testimony of
   others. We give credence to a historian of unsuspected integrity, or to
   a story which is related by a man of known veracity.

   2. That which gives a claim to credit, belief or confidence; as a
   letter of credence, which is intended to commend the bearer to the
   confidence of a third person.

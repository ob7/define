   TRI'ANGLE, n. [L. triangulum; tres, tria, three, and angulus, a
   corner.] In geometry, a figure bounded by three lines, and containing
   three angles. The three angles of a triangle are equal to two right
   angles, or the number of degrees in a semicircle.

   If the three lines or sides of a triangle are all right, it is a plane
   or rectilinear triangle.

   If all the three sides are equal, it is an equilateral triangle.

   If two of the sides only are equal, it is an isosceles or equicrural
   triangle.

   If all the three sides are unequal, it is a scalene or scalenous
   triangle.

   If one of the angles is a right angle, the triangle is rectangular.

   If one of the angles is obtuse, the triangle is called obtusangular or
   amblygonous.

   If all the angles are acute, the triangle is acutangular or oxygonous.

   If the three lines of a triangle are all curves, the triangle is said
   to be curvilinear.

   If some of the sides are right and others curve, the triangle is said
   to be mixtilinear.

   If the sides are all arcs of great circles of the sphere, the triangle
   is said to be spherical.

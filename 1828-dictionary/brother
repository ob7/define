    Lot, Jacob and Laban. Persons of the same profession call each other
      brother, as judges, clergymen, professors of religion, members of

      congregations by the title of brethren. In a more general sense,
   brother or brethren is used for man in general; all men being children
      of the same primitive ancestors, and forming one race of beings.

       contradistinction to a uterine brother, or by the mother only.

[1]heir

   HEIR, n. are. [L. haeres, haeredis.]

   1. The man who succeeds, or is to succeed another in the possession of
   lands, tenements and hereditaments, by descent; the man on whom the law
   casts an estate of inheritance by the death of the ancestor or former
   possessor; or the man in whom the title to an estate of inheritance is
   vested by the operation of law, on the death of a former owner.

   We give the title to a person who is to inherit after the death of an
   ancestor, and during his life, as well as to the person who has
   actually come into possession. A man's children are his heirs. In most
   monarchies,the king's eldest son is heir to the throne; and a
   nobleman's eldest son is heir to his title.

   Lo, one born in my house is my heir. Gen.15.

   2. One who inherits, or takes from an ancestor. The son is often heir
   to the disease, or to the miseries of the father.

   3. One who succeeds to the estate of a former possessor. Jer.49. Mic.1.

   4. One who is entitled to possess. In Scripture, saints are called
   heirs of the promise, heirs of righteousness, heirs of salvation, &c.,
   by virtue of the death of Christ, or of God's gracious promises.

     Heir-presumptive, one who, if the ancestor should die immediately,
    would be heir, but whose right of inheritance may be defeated by any
             contingency, as by the birth of a nearer relative.

       HEIR, v.t. are. To inherit; to take possession of an estate of
                inheritance, after the death of the ancestor.

[1]meekness

   MEE'KNESS, n. Softness of temper; mildness; gentleness; forbearance
   under injuries and provocations.

   1. In an evangelical sense, humility; resignation; submission to the
   divine will, without murmuring or peevishness; opposed to pride,
   arrogance and refractoriness. Gal.5.

   I beseech you by the meekness of Christ. 1 Cor.10.

   Meekness is a grace which Jesus alone inculcated, and which no ancient
   philosopher seems to have understood or recommended.

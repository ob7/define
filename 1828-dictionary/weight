   WEIGHT, n. Wate. [See Weigh.]

   1. The quantity of a body, ascertained by the balance; in a
   philosophical sense, that quality of bodies by which they tend towards
   the center of the earth in a line perpendicular to its surface. In
   short, weight is gravity, and the weight of a particular body is the
   amount of its gravity, or of the force with which it tends to the
   center. The weight of a body is in direct proportion to its quantity of
   matter.

   2. A mass of iron, lead, brass or other metal, to be used for
   ascertaining the weight of other bodies; as a weight of an ounce, a
   pound, a quarter of a hundred, &c. The weights of nations are different
   except those of England and the United States, which are the same.

   3. A ponderous mass; something heavy.

   A man leaps better with weights in his hands.

   4. Pressure; burden; as the weight of grief; weight of care; weight of
   business; weight of government.

   5. Importance; power; influence; efficacy; consequence; moment;
   impressiveness; as a argument of great weight; a consideration of vast
   weight. The dignity of a mans character adds weight to his words.

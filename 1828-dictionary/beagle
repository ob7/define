   BE'AGLE, n. [Gr. a pygmy.]

   A small hound, or hunting dog. Beagles are of different sorts; as the
   southern beagle, shorter and less, but thicker, than the deep-mouthed
   hound; the fleet northern, or cat beagle, smaller, and of a finer shape
   than the southern. From these species united, is bred a third, still
   preferable; and a smaller sort is letter larger than the lap-dog.

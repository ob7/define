[1]lane

   LANE, n.

   1. A narrow way or passage, or a private passage, as distinguished from
   a public road or highway. A lane may be open to all passengers, or it
   may be inclosed and appropriated to a man's private use. In the United
   States, the word is used chiefly in the country, and answers in a
   degree, to an alley in a city. It has sometimes been used for alley. In
   London, the word lane is added to the names of streets; as chancery
   lane.

   2. A passage between lines of men, or people standing on each side.

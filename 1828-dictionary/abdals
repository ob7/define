[1]abdals

   AB'DALS, n. The name of certain fanatics in Persia, who, in excess of
   zeal, sometimes run into the streets, and attempt to kill all they meet
   who are of a different religion; and if they are slain for their
   madness, they think it meritorious to die, and by the vulgar are deemed
   martyrs.

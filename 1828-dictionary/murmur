   MUR'MUR, n. [L. See the Verb.] A low sound continued or continually
   repeated, as that of a stream running in a stony channel, or that of
   flame.

   Black melancholy sits,

   Deepens the murmur of the falling floods,

   And breathes a browner horror on the woods.

   1. A complaint half suppressed, or uttered in a low,muttering voice.

   Some discontents there are, some idle murmurs.

                         MUR'MUR, v.i. [L. murmuro.]

   1. To make a low continued noise, like the hum of bees, a stream of
   water, rolling waves, or like the wind in a forest; as the murmuring
   surge.

   The forests murmur and the surges roar.

   2. To grumble; to complain; to utter complaints in a low,half
   articulated voice; to utter sullen discontent; with at, before the
   thing which is the cause of discontent; as, murmur not at sickness; or

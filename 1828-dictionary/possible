   POS'SIBLE, a. [L. possibilis, from posse. See Power.]

   That may be or exist; that may be now, or may happen or come to pass;
   that may be done; not contrary to the nature of things. It is possible
   that the Greeks and Turks may now be engaged in battle. It is possible
   that peace of Europe may continue a century. It is not physically
   possible that a stream should ascend a mountain, but it is possible
   that the Supreme Being may suspend a law of nature, that is, his usual
   course of proceeding. It is not possible that 2 and 3 should be 7, or
   that the same action should be morally right and morally wrong.

   This word when pronounced with a certain emphasis, implies
   improbability. A thing is possible, but very improbable.

   CAUSE, n. s as z.

   1. A suit or action in court; any legal process which a party
   institutes to obtain his demand, or by which he seeks his right or his
   supposed right. This is a legal, scriptural and popular use of the
   word, coinciding nearly with case from cado, and action from ago, to
   urge or drive.

   The cause of both parties shall come before the judges. Ex. 22.

   2. That which produces an effect; that which impels into existence, or
   by its agency or operation produces what did not before exist; that by
   virtue of which any thing is done; that from which any thing proceeds,
   and without which it would not exist.

   Cause is a substance exerting its power into act, to make a thing begin
   to be.

   3. The reason or motive that urges, moves, or impels the mind to act or
   decide.

   For this cause have I raised up Pharaoh. Ex. 9.

   And David said, is there not a cause? 1 Sam. 17.

   4. Sake; account.

   I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong. 2 Cor. 6. [See
   Sake.]

   5. That which a party or nation pursues; or rather pursuit, prosecution
   of an object. We say, Bible Societies are engaged in a noble cause.
   [See the first definition.] Hence the word cause is used to denote that
   which a person or thing favors; that to which the efforts of an
   intelligent being are directed; as, to promote religion is to advance
   the cause of God. So we say, the cause of truth or of justice. In all
   its applications, cause retains something of its original meaning,
   struggle, impelling force, contest, effort to obtain or to effect
   something.

   6. Without cause, without good reason; without a reason or motive to
   justify the act.

   They hate me without cause. Ps. 35. 69.

                                 CAUSE, v.t.

   1. To produce; to bring into existence.

   They caused great joy to all the brethren. Acts 15.

   2. To effect by agency, power or influence.

   I will cause it to rain on the earth forty days. Gen. 7.

   I will cause him to fall by the sword. 2 Kings 19.

                  CAUSE, v.i. To assign insufficient cause.

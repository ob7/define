[1]banter

   BAN'TER, v.t. [Gr. to mock, or deride.] To play upon in words and in
   good humor; to rally; to joke, or jest with. Banter hardly amounts to
   ridicule, much less to derision. It consists in being pleasant and
   witty with the actions of another, and raising a humorous laugh at his
   expense, often attended with some degree of sarcasm.

   BAN'TER, n. A joking or jesting; raillery; wit or humor; pleasantry.

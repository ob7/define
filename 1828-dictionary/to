   28. To-day, to-night, to-morrow, are peculiar phrases derived from our
    ancestors. To in the two first, has the sense or force of this; this
    day, this night. In the last, it is equivalent to in or on; in or on
   the morrow. The words may be considered as compounds, to-day, to-night,
      to-morrow, and usually as adverbs. But sometimes they are used as
                         nouns; as, to-day is ours.

     To and from, backward and forward. In this phrase, to is adverbial.

             To the face, in presence of; not in the absence of.

   I withstood him face to face. Gal.2.

   To-morrow, to-morrow, and to-morrow,

   Creeps in this petty pace from day to day.

   [Note.--In the foregoing explanation of to, it is to be considered that
    the definition given is not always the sense of to by itself, but the
    sense rather of the word preceding it, or connected with it, or of to
   in connection with other words. In general, to is used in the sense of
   moving towards a place, or towards an object, or it expresses direction
                  towards a place, end, object or purpose.]

   To is often used adverbially to modify the sense of verbs; as, to come
   to; to heave to. The sense of such phrases is explained under the verbs
                                respectively.

   In popular phrases like the following, "I will not come; you shall to,
      or too, a genuine Saxon phrase, to denotes moreover, besides, L.
                                  insuper.

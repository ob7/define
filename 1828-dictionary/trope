[1]trope

   TROPE, n. [L. tropus; Gr. to turn.] In rhetoric, a word or expression
   used in a different sense from that which it properly signifies; or a
   word changed from its original signification to another, for the sake
   of giving life or emphasis to an idea, as when we call a stupid fellow
   an ass, or a shrewd man a fox.

   Tropes are chiefly of four kinds, metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, and
   irony. Some authors make figure the genus, of which trope is a species;
   others make them different things, defining trope to be a change of
   sense, and figure to be any ornament, except what becomes so by such
   change.

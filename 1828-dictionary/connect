   CONNECT, v.t. [L.]

   1. To knit or link together; to tie or fasten together, as by something
   intervening, or by weaving, winding or twining. Hence,

   2. To join or unite; to conjoin, in almost any manner, either by
   junction, by any intervening means, or by order and relation. We
   connect letters and words in a sentence; we connect ideas in the mind;
   we connect arguments in a discourse. The strait of Gibraltar connects
   the Mediterranean with the Atlantic. A treaty connects two nations. The
   interests of agriculture are connected with those of commerce. Families
   are connected by marriage or by friendship.

   CONNECT, v.i. To join, unite or cohere; to have a close relation. This
       argument connects with another. [This use is rare and not well
                                authorized.]

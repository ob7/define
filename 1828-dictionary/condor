[1]condor

   CONDOR, n. The largest species of fowl hitherto discovered; a native of
   South America. Some naturalists class it with the vulture; others, with
   the eagle. The wings of the largest, when expanded, are said to extend
   15 or 18 feet; and the fowl has strength to bear off a calf or a deer.

   The size of the Condor has been greatly exaggerated. It is about the
   size of the Lammer-geyer or vulture of the Alps, which it resembles in
   its habits. It is properly a vulture.

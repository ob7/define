   AFFECT', v.t. [L. afficio, affectum, of ad and facio, to make; affecto,
   to desire, from the same room. Affect is to make to, or upon to press
   upon.]

   1. To act upon; to produce an effect or change upon; as, cold affects
   the body; loss affects our interests.

   2. To act upon, or move the passions; as, affected with grief.

   3. To aim at; aspire to; desire or entertain pretension to; as, to
   affect imperial sway. [See the etymology of Affair.]

   4. To tend to by natural affinity or disposition; as, the drops of a
   fluid affect a spherical form.

   5. To love, or regard with fondness.

   Think not that wars we love and strife affect.

   [This sense is closely allied to the third.]

   6. To make a show of; to attempt to imitate, in a manner not natural;
   to study the appearance of what is not natural, or real; as, to affect
   to be grave; affected friendship.

   It seems to have been used formerly for convict or attaint, as in
   Ayliffe's Parergon; but this sense is not now in use.

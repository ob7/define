   PRIEST, n. [L. proestes, a chief, one that presides; proe, before,and
   sto, to stand, or sisto.]

   1. A man who officiates in sacred offices. Among pagans, priests were
   persons whose appropriate business was to offer sacrifices and perform
   other sacred rites of religion. In primitive ages, the fathers of
   families, princes and kings were priests. Thus Cain and Abel, Noah,
   Abraham, Melchizedek,Job, Isaac and Jacob offered their own sacrifices.
   In the days of Moses, the office of priest was restricted to the tribe
   of Levi, and the priesthood consisted of three orders, the high priest,
   the priests, and the Levites, and the office was made hereditary in the
   family of Aaron.

   Every priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things
   pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for
   sins. Heb.5.

   2. In the modern church, a person who is set apart or consecrated to
   the ministry of the gospel; a man in orders or licensed to preach the
   gospel; a presbyter. In its most general sense, the word includes
   archbishops, bishops, patriarchs, and all subordinate orders of the
   clergy, duly approved and licensed according to the forms and rules of
   each respective denomination of christians; as all these orders "are
   ordained for men in things pertaining to God." But in Great Britain,
   the word is understood to denote the subordinate orders of the clergy,
   above a deacon and below a bishop. In the United States, the word
   denotes any licensed minister of the gospel.

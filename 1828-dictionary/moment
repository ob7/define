   MO'MENT, n. [L. momentum. This word is contracted from motamentum, or
   some other word,the radical verb of which signified to move, rush,
   drive or fall suddenly, which sense gives that of force. The sense of
   an instant of time is from falling or rushing, which accords well with
   that of meet.]

   In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye. 1 Cor.15.

   2. Force; impulsive power.

   the others.

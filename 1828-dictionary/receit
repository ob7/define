   RECE'IT, n. rece't. [L. receptus. This word wought to follow the

   without p, receit.]

   1. The act of receiving; as the receit of a letter.

   2. The place of receiving; as the receit of custom.

   3. Reception; as the receit of blessings or mercies.

   [In this sense, reception is now used.]

   6. In commerce, a writing acknowledging the taking of money or goods. A
   receit of money may be in part or in full payment of a debt, and it
   operates as an acquittance or discharge of the debt either in part or
   in full. A receit of goods makes the receiver liable to account for the
   same, according to the nature of the transaction, or the tenor of the
   writing. It is customary for sheriffs to deliver goods taken in
   execution, to some person who gives his receit for them, with a promise
   to redeliver them to the sheriff at or before the time of sale.

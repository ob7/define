[1]consubstantiation

   CONSUBSTANTIATION, n. The union of the body of our blessed Savior with
   the sacramental elements. The Lutherans maintain that after
   consecration of the elements, the body and blood of Christ are
   substantially present with the substance of the bread and wine, which
   is called consubstantiation or impanation.

[1]eclogue

   EC'LOGUE, n. ec'log. [Gr. choice, to select.] Literally, a select
   piece. Hence, in poetry, a pastoral composition, in which shepherds are
   introduced conversing with each other, as the eclogues of Virgil; or it
   is a little elegant composition in a simple natural style and manner.
   An eclogue differs from an idyllion, in being appropriated to pieces in
   which shepherds are introduced.

   DARE, v.i. pret. durst. To have courage to any purpose; to have
   strength of mind or hardihood to undertake anything; to be bold enough;
   not to be afraid; to venture; to be adventurous.

   Dare any of you go to law before the unjust? 1
   Cor. vi

   None of his disciples durst ask him, who art thou.
   John xxi

   In this intransitive sense, dare is not generally followed by the sign
   to before another verb in the infinitive; though to may be used with
   propriety. In German, the verb is numbered among the auxiliaries. In
   the transitive form, it is regular; thus,

   DARE, v.t. pret. and pp. dared. To challenge; to provoke; to defy; as,
                           to dare a man to fight.

   Time, I dare thee to discover such a youth and
   such a lover. Dryden.

   To dare larks, to catch them by means of a looking glass, or by keeping
   a bird of prey hovering aloft, which keeps them in amaze till caught;
   to terrify or amaze.

                         DARE, Defiance; challenge.

                DARE, n. A small fish, the same as the dace.

   MUSK'ET, n. [L. musca, a fly.]

   1. A species of fire-arms used in war, and fired by means of a lighted
   match. This manner of firing was in use as late as the civil war in
   England. But the proper musket is no longer in use. The name, however,
   in common speech, is yet applied to fusees or fire-locks fired by a
   spring lock.

   2. A male hawk of a small kind, the female of which is the sparrow
   hawk.

   CONJURE, v.t. [L., to swear together, to conspire.]

   1. To call on or summon by a sacred name, or in a solemn manner; to
   implore with solemnity. It seems originally to have signified, to bind
   by an oath.

   I conjure you! Let him know, whateer was done against him, Cato did it.

   2. To bind two or more by an oath; to unite in a common design. Hence
   intransitively, to conspire. [Not usual.]

   CONJURE, v.t. To expel, to drive or to affect, in some manner, by magic
   arts, as by invoking the Supreme Being, or by the use of certain words,
      characters or ceremonies to engage supernatural influence; as, to
    conjure up evil spirits, or to conjure down a tempest; to conjure the
                                   stars.

   Note. It is not easy to define this word, nor any word of like import;
   as the practices of conjurors are little known, or various and
   indefinite. The use of this word indicates that an oath or solemn
   invocation originally formed a part of the ceremonies.

                                CONJURE, v.i.

   1. To practice the arts of a conjurer; to use arts to engage the aid of
   spirits in performing some extraordinary act.

   2. In a vulgar sense, to behave very strangely; to act like a witch; to
   play tricks.

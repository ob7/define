   AD'MIRALTY, n. In Great Britain, the office of Lord High Admiral. This
   office is discharged by one person, or by Commissioners, called Lords
   of the Admiralty; usually seven in number.

   The admiralty court, or court of admiralty, is the supreme court for
   the trial of maritime causes, held before the Lord High Admiral, or
   Lords of the admiralty.

   In general, a court of admiralty is a court for the trial of causes
   arising on the high seas, as prize causes and the like. In the United
   States, there is no admiralty court, distinct from others; but the
   district courts, established in the several states by Congress, are
   invested with admiralty powers.

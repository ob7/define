   TE'DIOUS, a. [L. toedium.]

   1. Wearisome; tiresome from continuance, prolixity, or slowness which
   causes prolixity. We say, a man is tedious in relating a story; a
   minister is tedious in his sermon. We say also, a discourse is tedious,
   when it wearies by its length or dullness.

   2. Slow; as a tedious course.

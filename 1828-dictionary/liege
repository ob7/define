   LIEGE, a. [L. ligo, to bind; Gr. to bind, to bend; a withe.]

   1. Bound by a feudal tenure; obliged to be faithful and loyal to a
   superior, as a vassal to his lord; subject; faithful; as a liege man.
   By liege homage, a vassal was bound to serve his lord against all,
   without excepting his sovereign; or against all, excepting a former
   lord to whom he owed like service.

   2. Sovereign; as a liege lord. [See the noun.]

                             LIEGE, n. [supra.]

   1. A vassal holding a fee by which he is bound to perform certain
   services and duties to his lord.

   2. A lord or superior; a sovereign.

   [Note. This is a false application of the word, arising probably from
   transferring the word from the vassal to the lord; the lord of liege
   men, being called liege lord.

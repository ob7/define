   DURESS, n. [L. See Durable.]

   1. Literally, hardship; hence, constraint. Technically, duress, in law,
   is of two kinds; duress of imprisonment, which is imprisonment or
   restraint of personal liberty; and duress by menaces or threats [per
   minas,] when a person is threatened with loss of life or limb. Fear of
   battery is no duress. Duress then is imprisonment or threats intended
   to compel a person to do a legal act, as to execute a deed; or to
   commit an offense; in which cases the act is voidable or excusable.

   2. Imprisonment; restraint of liberty.

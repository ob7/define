   FIRE, n. [The radical sense of fire is usually, to rush, to rage, to be
   violently agitated; and if this is the sense of fire, in coincides with
   L. furo. It may be from shining or consuming.]

   1. Heat and light emanating visibly, perceptibly and simultaneously
   from any body; caloric; the unknown cause of the sensation of heat and
   of the retrocession of the homogeneous particles of bodies from one
   another, producing expansion, and thus enlarging all their dimensions;
   one of the causes of magnetism, as evinced by Dr. Hare's calorimotor.

   In the popular acceptation of the word, fire is the effect of
   combustion. The combustible body ignited or heated to redness we call
   fire; and when ascending in a stream or body, we call it flame. A piece
   of charcoal in combustion, is of a red color and very hot. In this
   state it is said to be on fire, or to contain fire. When combustion
   ceases, it loses its redness and extreme heat, and we say, the fire is
   extinct.

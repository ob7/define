[1]gondola

   GON'DOLA, n. A flat-bottomed boat, very long and narrow, used at Venice
   in Italy on the canals. A gondola of middle size is about thirty feet
   long and four broad, terminating at each end in a sharp point or peak
   rising to the highth of a man. It is usually rowed by two men, called
   gondoliers, who propel the boat by pushing the oars. The gondola is
   also used in other parts of Italy for a passage boat.

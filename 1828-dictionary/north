[1]north

   NORTH, n. [I know not the origin of this word, nor its primary sense.
   It may have been applied first to the pole star, or to the wind, like
   Boreas.] One of the cardinal points, being that point of the horizon
   which is directly opposite to the sun in the meridian, on the left hand
   when we stand with the face to the east; or it is that point of
   intersection of the horizon and meridian which is nearest our pole.

   NORTH, a. Being in the north; as the north polar star.

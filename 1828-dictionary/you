[1]you

   YOU, pron. Yu. [You has been considered as in the plural only, and is
   so treated in the Saxon grammar. But from the Belgic dialect, it
   appears to be in the singular as well as the plural, and our universal
   popular usage, in applying it to a single person with a verb in the
   singular number, is correct. Yourself is in the singular number.]

   1. The pronoun of the second person, in the nominative or objective
   case. In familiar language, it is applied to an individual, as thou is
   in the solemn style. In the plural, it is used in the solemn style in
   the objective case.

   In vain you tell your parting lover, you wish fair winds may waft him
   over.

   He that despiseth you, despiseth me. Luke 10.

   2. You is used, like on in French, for any one. This at a distance
   looks like a rock; but as you approach it, you see a little cabin.

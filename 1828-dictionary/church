   CHURCH, n.

   1. A house consecrated to the worship of God, among Christians; the
   Lords house. This seems to be the original meaning of the word. The
   Greek, to call out or call together, denotes an assembly or collection.
   But, Lord, a term applied by the early Christians to Jesus Christ; and
   the house in which they worshipped was named from the title. So church
   goods, bona ecclesiastica; the Lords day, dies dominica.

   2. The collective body of Christians, or of those who profess to
   believe in Christ, and acknowledge him to be the Savior of mankind. In
   this sense, the church is sometimes called the Catholic or Universal
   Church.

   3. A particular number of christens, united under one form of
   ecclesiastical government, in one creed, and using the same ritual and
   ceremonies; as the English church; the Gallican church; the
   Presbyterian church; the Romish church; the Greek church.

   4. The followers of Christ in a particular city or province; as the
   church of Ephesus, or of Antioch.

   5. The disciples of Christ assembled for worship in a particular place,
   as in a private house. Col. 4.

   6. The worshipers of Jehovah or the true God, before the advent of
   Christ; as the Jewish church.

   7. The body of clergy, or ecclesiastics, in distinction from the laity.
   Hence, ecclesiastical authority.

   8. An assembly of sacred rulers convened in Christs name to execute his
   laws.

   9. The collective body of Christians, who have made a public profession
   of the Christian religion, and who are untied under the same pastor; in
   distinction from those who belong to the same parish, or ecclesiastical
   society, but have made no profession of their faith.

   CHURCH, v.t. To perform with any one the office of returning thanks in
      the church, after any signal deliverance, as from the dangers of
                                 childbirth.

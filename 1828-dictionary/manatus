[1]manatus

   MANA'TUS, n. The sea-cow, or fish-tailed walrus,an animal of the genus
   Trichechus, which grows to an enormous size; sometimes it is said, to
   the length twenty three feet. Of this animal there are two
   varieties,the australis, or lamentin, and borealis, or whale-tailed
   manati. It has fore feet palmated,and furnished with claws, but the
   hind part ends in a tail like that of a fish. The skin is of a dark
   color,the eyes small, and instead of teeth, the mouth is furnished with
   hard bones, extending the whole length of the jaws.

   [There are eight grinders on each side in each jaw.] It never leaves
   the water, but frequents the mouths of rivers, feeding on grass that
   grows in the water.

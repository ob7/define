      10. In this line of Spenser, it may signify to throw, for this is
                          nearly the primary sense.

   His sparkling blade about his head he blest.

   Johnson supposes the word to signify to wave or brandish, and to have
   received this sense from the old rite of blessing a field, by directing
   the hands to all parts of it.

    Bless in Spenser for bliss, may be so written, not for rhyme merely,
             but because bless and bliss are from the same root.

[1]porphyry

   POR'PHYRY, n. [Gr. purple; L. porphyrites.] A mineral consisting of a
   homogeneous ground with crystals of some other mineral imbedded, giving
   to the mass a speckled complexion. One variety of Egyptian porphyry has
   a purple ground, whence the name of the species; but the homogeneous
   ground with imbedded crystals, being all that is essential to porphyry,
   its composition and colors are consequently various.

   Porphyry is very hard, and susceptible of a fine polish.

   Porphyry is composed of paste in which are disseminated a multitude of
   little angular and granuliform parts, of a color different from the
   ground.

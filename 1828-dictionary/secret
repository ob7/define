[1]secret

   SE'CRET, a. [L. secretus. This is given as the participle of secerno,
   but is radically a different word. The radical sense of seg is to
   separate, as in L. seco, to cut off; and not improbably this word is
   contracted into the Latin se, a prefix in segrego, separo, &c.]

   knowledge of all persons except the individual or individuals
   concerned.

   I have a secret errand to thee, O king. Judges 3.

   There secret in her sapphire cell,

[1]yenite

   YENITE, n. A mineral found in the isle of Elba, and in other places, of
   a brown or brownish black color. It is arranged with the chrysolite
   family, but differs much from other species of it. It resembles
   hornblend, or rather black epidote. It occurs both crystalized and
   massive; the form of the crystals being that of a rhomboidal prism. It
   consists chiefly of silex, lime, and oxyd of manganese. This mineral is
   called yenite or jenite in commemoration of the battle of Jena, and
   lievrite, from its discoverer.

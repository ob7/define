[1]humidity

   HUMID'ITY, n. Moisture; dampness; a moderate degree of wetness which is
   perceptible to the eye or touch, occasioned by the absorption of a
   fluid, or its adherence to the surface of a body. When a cloth has
   imbibed any fluid to such a degree that it can be felt, we call it
   humid; but when no humidity is perceptible, we say it is dry.
   Quicksilver communicates no humidity to our hands or clothes, for it
   does not adhere to them; but it will adhere to gold, tin and lead, and
   render them humid and soft to the touch.

   1. Moisture in the form of visible vapor, or perceptible in the air.

   artificially prepared in Persia, like niter. It comes in three states.
   1. Crude borax, tinkal, or chrysocolla, from Persia, in greenish masses
   of a greasy feel, or in opake crystals. 2. Borax of China, somewhat
   purer, in small plates or masses, irregularly crystallized, and of a

   crystals, which is the kind generally used. It is an excellent flux in
   docimastic operations, a styptic in medicine, and useful in soldering
   metals.

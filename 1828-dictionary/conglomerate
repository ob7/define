   CONGLOMERATE, a. [L., to wind into a ball, a ball, a clew. See
   Glomerate.]

   1. Gathered into a ball or round body. A conglomerate gland is composed
   of many smaller glands, whose excretory ducts unite in a common one, as
   the live, kidneys, pancreas, parotids, &c. Each little granulated
   portion furnishes a small tube, which unites with other similar ducts,
   to form the common excretory duct of the gland.

   2. In botany, conglomerate flowers grow on a branching peduncle or foot
   stalk, on short pedicles, closely compacted together without order;
   opposed to diffused.

   3. Conglomerate rocks. [See Puddingstone.]

   CONGLOMERATE, v.t. To gather into a ball or round body; to collect into
                                a round mass.

     CONGLOMERATE, n. In mineralogy, a sort of pudding-stone, or coarse
    sandstone, composed of pebbles of quartz, flint, siliceous slate, &c.

[1]contrition

   CONTRITION, n. [L.]

   1. The act of grinding or rubbing to powder.

   2. Penitence; deep sorrow for sin; grief of heart for having offended
   and infinitely holy and benevolent God. The word is usually understood
   to mean genuine penitence, accompanied with a deep sense of ingratitude
   in the sinner, and sincere resolution to live in obedience to the
   divine law.

   Fruits of more pleasing savor, from thy seed sown with contrition in
   his heart.

   Imperfect repentance is by some divines called attrition.

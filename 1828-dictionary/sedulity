[1]sedulity

   SEDU'LITY, n. [L. sedulitas. See Sedulous.] Diligent and assiduous
   application to business; constant attention; unremitting industry in
   any pursuit. It denotes constancy and perseverance rather than
   intenseness of application.

   Let there be but the same propensity and bent of will to religion, and
   there will be the same sedulity and indefatigable industry in men's
   inquiries into it. South.

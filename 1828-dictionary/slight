   SLIGHT, a. [It seems that slight belongs to the family of sleek,
   smooth.]

   1. Weak; inconsiderable; not forcible; as a slight impulse; a slight
   effort.

   2. Not deep; as a slight impression.

   3. Not violent; as a slight disease, illness or indisposition.

   4. Trifling; of no great importance. Slight is the subject, but not so
   the praise.

   5. Not strong; not cogent. Some firmly embrace doctrines upon slight
   grounds.

   6. Negligent; not vehement; not done with effort. The shaking of the
   head is a gesture of slight refusal.

   7. Not firm or strong; thin; of loose texture; as slight silk.

   8. Foolish; silly; weak in intellect.

                                 SLIGHT, n.

   1. Neglect; disregard; a moderate degree of contempt manifested
   negatively by neglect. It expresses less than contempt, disdain and
   scorn.

   2. Artifice; dexterity. [See Sleight.]

                                SLIGHT, v.t.

   1. To neglect; to disregard from the consideration that a thing is of
   little value and unworthy of notice; as, to slight the divine commands,
   or the offers of mercy.

   2. To overthrow; to demolish. [Not used.] "The rogues slighted me into
   the river," in Shakespeare, is not used.

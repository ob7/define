[1]possibility

   POSSIBIL'ITY, n. [from possible.] The power of being or existing; the
   power of happening; the state of being possible. It often implies
   improbability or great uncertainty. There is a possibility that a new
   star may appear this night. There is a possibility of a hard frost in
   July in our latitude. It is not expedient to hazard much on the bare
   possibility of success. It is prudent to reduce contracts to writing,
   and to render them so explicit as to preclude the possibility of
   mistake or controversy.

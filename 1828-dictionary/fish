   FISH, n. [L. piscis.]

   1. An animal that lives in water. Fish is a general name for a class of
   animals subsisting in water, which were distributed by Linne into six
   orders. They breathe by means of gills, swim by the aid of fins, and
   are oviparous. Some of them have the skeleton bony, and others
   cartilaginous. Most of the former have the opening of the gills closed
   by a peculiar covering, called the gill-lid; many of the latter have no
   gill-lid, and are hence said to breathe through apertures. Cetaceous
   animals, as the whale and dolphin, are, in popular language, called
   fishes, and have been so classed by some naturalists; but they breathe
   by lungs, and are viviparous, like quadrupeds. The term fish has been
   also extended to other aquatic animals, such as shell-fish, lobsters,
   &c. We use fish, in the singular, for fishes in general or the whole
   race.

   2. The flesh of fish, used as food. But we usually apply flesh to land
   animals.

                                 FISH, v.i.

                                 FISH, v.t.

   2. In seamanship, to strengthen, as a mast or yard, with a piece of
   timber.

   3. To catch; draw out or up; as, to fish up a human body when sunk; to

   PAS'SION, n. [L. passio, from patior, to suffer.]

   1. The impression or effect of an external agent upon a body; that
   which is suffered or received.

   A body at rest affords us no idea of any active power to move, and when
   set in motion, it is rather a passion than an action in it.

   2. Susceptibility of impressions from external agents.

   The differences of moldable and not moldable, &c., and many other
   passions of matter, are plebeian notions. [Little used.]

   3. Suffering; emphatically, the last suffering of the Savior.

   To whom also he showed himself alive after his passion, by many
   infallible proofs. Acts 1.

   4. The feeling of the mind, or the sensible effect of impression;
   excitement, perturbation or agitation of mind; as desire, fear,
   hope,joy, grief,love, hatred. The eloquence of the orator is employed
   to move the passions.

   5. Violent agitation or excitement of mind, particularly such as is
   occasioned by an offense, injury or insult; hence, violent anger.

   6. Zeal; ardor; vehement desire.

   When statesmen are ruled by faction and interest, they can have no
   passion for the glory of their country.

   7. Love.

   He owned his passion for Amestris.

   8. Eager desire; as a violent passion for fine clothes.

            PAS'SION, v.i. To be extremely agitated. [Not used.]

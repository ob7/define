[1]restrain

   RESTRA'IN, v.t. [L. restringo; re and stringo, to strain. The letter g
   appears from the participle to be casual; stringo, for strigo. Hence
   strictus, strict, stricture. If the two letters st are removed, the
   word rigo coincides exactly, in primary sense, with L. rego, rectus,
   right, and the root of reach, stretch, straight.]

   1. To hold back; to check; to hold from action, proceeding or
   advancing, either by physical or moral force, or by an interposing
   obstacle. Thus we restrain a horse by a bridle; we restrain cattle from
   wandering by fences; we restrain water by dams and dikes; we restrain
   men from crimes and trespasses by laws; we restrain young people, when
   we can, by arguments or counsel; we restrain men and their passions; we
   restrain the elements; we attempt to restrain vice, but not always with
   success.

   2. To repress; to keep in awe; as, to restrain offenders.

   3. To suppress; to hinder or repress; as, to restrain excess.

   4. To abridge; to hinder from unlimited enjoyment; as, to restrain one
   of his pleasure or of his liberty.

   5. To limit; to confine.

   Not only a metaphysical or natural, but a moral universality is also to
   be restrained by a part of the predicate.

   6. To withhold; to forbear.

   Thou restrainest prayer before God. Job 15.

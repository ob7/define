   TEM'PORAL, a. [L. temporalis, from tempus, time.]

   1. Pertaining to this life or this world or the body only; secular; as
   temporal concerns; temporal affairs. In this sense, it is opposed to
   spiritual. Let not temporal affairs or employments divert the mind from
   spiritual concerns, which are far more important.

   In this sense also it is opposed to ecclesiastical; as temporal power,
   that is, secular, civil or political power; temporal courts, those
   which take cognizance of civil suits. Temporal jurisdiction is that
   which regards civil and political affairs.

   2. Measured or limited by time, or by this life or this state of
   things; having limited existence; opposed to eternal.

   The things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not
   seen are eternal. 2 Cor.4.

   3. In grammar, relating to a tense; as a temporal augment.

   4. Pertaining to the temple or temples of the head; as the temporal
   bone; a temporal artery or vein; temporal muscle.

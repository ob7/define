[1]technical

   TECH'NICAL, a. [L. technicus; Gr. art, artifice; to fabricate, make or
   prepare.]

   1. Pertaining to art or the arts. A technical word is a word that
   belongs properly or exclusively to an art; as the verb to smelt,
   belongs to metallurgy. So we say, technical phrases, technical
   language. Every artificer has his technical terms.

   2. Belonging to a particular profession; as, the words of an indictment
   must be technical.

   It is of the utmost importance clearly to understand the technical
   terms used by the eastern theologians.

[1]leaven

   LEAVEN, n. lev'n. [L. levo, Eng. to lift.]

   1. A mass of sour dough, which, mixed with a larger quantity of dough
   or paste, produces fermentation in it and renders it light. During the
   seven days of the passover, no leaven was permitted to be in the houses
   of the Jews. Ex. 12.

   2. Any thing which makes a general change in the mass. It generally
   means something which corrupts or depraves that with which it is mixed.

   Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.

                                  Matt. 16.

                             LEAVEN, v.t. lev'n.

   1. To excite fermentation in; to raise and make light, as dough or
   paste.

   A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. 1Cor. 5.

   2. to taint; to imbue.

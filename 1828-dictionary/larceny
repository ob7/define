[1]larceny

   L'ARCENY, n. [L. latrocinium.]

   Theft; the act of taking and carrying away the goods or property of
   another feloniously. Larceny is of two kinds; simple larceny, or theft,
   not accompanied with any atrocious circumstance; and mixed or compound
   larceny, which includes in it the aggravation of taking from one's
   house or person, as in burglary or robbery. The stealing of any thing
   below the value of twelve pence, is called petty larceny; above that
   value, it is called grand larceny.

[1]ally

   ALLY', v.t. [L. ligo.]

   1. To unite, or form a relation, as between families by marriage, or
   between princes and states by treaty, league or confederacy.

   2. To form a relation by similitude, resemblance or friendship. Note.
   This word is more generally used in the passive form, as families are
   allied by blood; or reciprocally, as princes ally themselves to
   powerful states.

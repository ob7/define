   OATH, n.

   A solemn affirmation or declaration, made with an appeal to God for the
   truth of what is affirmed. The appeal to God in an oath, implies that
   the person imprecates his vengeance and renounces his favor if the
   declaration is false, or if the declaration is a promise, the person
   invokes the vengeance of God if he should fail to fulfill it. A false
   oath is called perjury.

[1]assassins

   ASSAS'SINS, n. In Syria, a tribe or clan called Ismaelians, Batanists
   or Batenians. They originated in Persia about the year 1090; whence a
   colony migrated and settled on the mountains of Lebanon, and were
   remarkable for their assassinations. Their religion was a compound of
   magianism, judaism, and christianity. One article of their creed was,
   that the Holy Spirit resided in their Chief, and that his orders
   proceeded from God himself. He was called Scheik, and is better known
   by the denomination of Old man of the mountain. This barbarous
   chieftain and his followers spread terror among nations far and near,
   for almost two centuries, when the tribe was subdued by Sultan Bibaris.

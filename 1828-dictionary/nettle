   NETTLE, n. A plant of the genus Urtica, whose prickles fret the skin
   and occasion very painful sensations.

   And near the noisome nettle blooms the rose.

   NETTLE, v.t. To fret or sting; to irritate or vex; to excite sensations
   of displeasure or uneasiness, not amounting to wrath or violent anger.

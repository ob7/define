[1]ether

   E'THER, n. [L. oether; Gr. to burn, to shine; Eng. weather.]

   1. A thin, subtil matter, much finer and rarer than air, which, some
   philosophers suppose, begins from the limits of the atmosphere and
   occupies the heavenly space.

   There fields of light and liquid ether flow.

   2. In chimistry, a very light, volatile and inflammable fluid, produced
   by the distillation of alcohol or rectified spirit of wine, with an
   acid. It is lighter than alcohol, of a strong sweet smell, susceptible
   of great expansion, and of a pungent taste. It is so volatile, that
   when shaken it is dissipated in an instant.

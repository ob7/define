   RELY', v.i. [re and lie, or from the root of lie, lay.]

   To rest on something, as the mind when satisfied of the veracity,
   integrity or ability of persons, or of the certainty of facts or of
   evidence; to have confidence in; to trust in; to depend; with on. We
   rely on the promise of a man who is known to be upright; we rely on the
   veracity or fidelity of a tried friend; a prince relies on the
   affections of his subjects for support, and on the strength of his army
   for success in war; above all things, we rely on the mercy and promises
   of God. That which is the ground of confidence, is a certainty or full
   conviction that satisfies the mind and leaves it at rest, or
   undisturbed by doubt.

   Because thou has relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the
   Lord thy God - 2Chron. 16.

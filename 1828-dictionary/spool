   SPOOL, n. [G.] A piece of cane or reed, or a hollow cylinder of wood
   with a ridge at each end; used by weavers to wind their yarn upon in
   order to slaie it and wind in on the beam. The spool is larger than the
   quill, on which yarn is wound for the shuttle. But in manufactories,
   the word may be differently applied.

   SPOOL, v.t. To wind on spools.

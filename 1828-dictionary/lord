[1]lord

   LORD, n.

   1. A master; a person possessing supreme power and authority; a ruler;
   a governor.

   Man over man he made not lord.

   But now I was the lord of this fair mansion.

   2. A tyrant; an oppressive ruler.

   3. A husband.

   I oft in bitterness of soul deplores my absent daughter, and my dearer
   lord.

   My lord also being old. Gen. 18.

   4. A baron; the proprietor of a manor; as the lord of the manor.

   5. A nobleman; a title of honor in Great Britain given to those who are
   noble by birth or creation; a peer of the realm, including dukes,
   marquises, earls, viscounts and barons. Archbishops and bishops also,
   as members of the house of lords, are lords of parliament. Thus we say,
   lords temporal and spiritual. By courtesy also the title is given to
   the sons of dukes and marquises, and to the eldest sons of earls.

   6. An honorary title bestowed on certain official characters; as lord
   advocate, lord chamberlain, lord chancellor, lord chief justice, &c.

   7. In scripture, the Supreme Being; Jehovah. When Lord, in the Old
   Testament, is prints in capitals, it is the translation of JEHOVAH, and
   so might, with more propriety, be rendered. The word is applied to
   Christ, Ps. 110. Col. 3. and to the Holy Spirit, 2Thess. 3. As a title
   of respect, it is applied to kings, Gen. 40. 2Sam. 19. to princes and
   nobles, Gen 42. Dan. 4. to a husband, Gen. 18. to a prophet, 1Kings 18.
   2Kings 2. and to a respectable person, Gen. 24. Christ is called the
   Lord of glory, 1Cor. 2. and Lord of lords, Rev. 19.

       LORD, v.t. To invest with the dignity and privileges of a lord.

      LORD, v.i. To domineer; to rule with arbitrary or despotic sway;
     sometimes followed by over, and sometimes by it, in the manner of a
                              transitive verb.

   The whiles she lordeth in licentious bliss.

   I see them lording it in London streets.

   They lorded over them whom now they serve.

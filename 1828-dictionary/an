[1]an

   AN, a. [L. unus, una, unum; Gr.]

   One; noting an individual, either definitely, known, certain,
   specified, or understood; or indefinitely, not certain, known, or
   specified. Definitely, as "Noah built an ark of Gopher wood." "Paul was
   an eminent apostle." Indefinitely, as "Bring me an orange." Before a
   consonant the letter n is dropped, as a man; but our ancestors wrote an
   man, an king. This letter represents an definitely, or indefinitely.
   Definitely, as "I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to
   you a God." Ex. 6. Indefinitely, as "the province of a judge is to
   decide controversies." An being the same word as one, should not be
   used with it; "such an one" is tautology; the true phrase is such one.
   Although an, a and one, are the same word, and always have the same
   sense, yet by custom, an and a are used exclusively as a definite
   adjective, and one is used in numbering. Where our ancestors wrote an,
   twa, thry, we now use one, two, three. So an and a are never used
   except with a noun; but one like other adjectives, is sometimes used
   without its noun, and as a substitute for it; "one is at a loss to
   assign a reason for such conduct."

      AN, in old English authors, signifies if; as, "an it please your
    honor." Gr.; L. an, if or whether. It is probably an imperative, like
                               if, gif, give.

   PRINCE, n. prins. [L. princeps.]

   1. In a general sense, a sovereign; the chief and independent ruler of
   a nation or state. Thus when we speak of the princes of Europe, we
   include emperors and kings. Hence, a chief in general; as a prince of
   the celestial host.

   2. A sovereign in a certain territory; one who has the government of a
   particular state or territory, but holds of a superior to whom he owes
   certain services; as the princes of the German states.

   3. The son of a king or emperor, or the issue of a royal family; as
   princes of the blood. In England, the eldest son of the king is created
   prince of Wales.

   4. The chief of any body of men.

   5. A chief or ruler of either sex. Queen Elizabeth is called by Camden
   prince, but this application is unusual and harsh.

    Prince of the senate, in ancient Rome, was the person first called in
        the roll of senators. He was always of consular and censorian

                                  dignity.

    In Scripture, this name prince is given to God, Dan.8; to Christ, who
    is called the prince of peace, Is.9, and the prince of life, Acts 3.;
    to the chief of the priests, the prince of the sanctuary, Is.43.; to
     the Roman emperor, Dan.9.; to men of superior worth and excellence,
    Eccles. 10.; to nobles, counselors and officers of a kingdom, Is.10.;
     to the chief men of families or tribes, Num. 17.; to Satan, who is
   called the prince of this world, John 12.., and prince of the power of
                               the air, Eph.2.

               PRINCE, v.i. To play the prince; to take state.

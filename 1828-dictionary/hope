[1]hope

   HOPE, n. [L. cupio.]

   1. A desire of some good, accompanied with at least a slight
   expectation of obtaining it, or a belief that it is obtainable. Hope
   differs from wish and desire in this, that it implies some expectation
   of obtaining the good desired, or the possibility of possessing it.
   Hope therefore always gives pleasure or joy; whereas wish and desire
   may produce or be accompanied with pain and anxiety.

   The hypocrite's hope shall perish. Job.8.

   He wish'ed, but not with hope--

   Sweet hope! kind cheat!

   He that lives upon hope, will die fasting.

   2. Confidence in a future event; the highest degree of well founded
   expectation of good; as a hope founded on God's gracious promises; a
   scriptural sense.

   A well founded scriptural hope,is, in our religion, the source of
   ineffable happiness.

   3. That which gives hope; he or that which furnishes ground of
   expectation, or promises desired good. The hope of Israel is the
   Messiah.

   The Lord will be the hope of his people. Joel 3.

   4. An opinion or belief not amounting to certainty, but grounded on
   substantial evidence. The christian indulges a hope, that his sins are

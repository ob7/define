   APLO'ME, n. [Gr. simple.]

   A mineral closely allied to garnet. It is considered by Jameson, as
   crystallized common garnet. It is a rare mineral, found in
   dodecahedrons, with rhombic faces, supposed to be derived from the
   cube, by one of the most simple laws of decrement, that of a single
   range of particles, parallel to all the edges of a cube.

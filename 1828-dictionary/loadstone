   LOADSTONE, n. [from the verb lead and stone. The old orthography,
   lodestone, is most correct, as this word has no connection with the
   verb to load.]

   The native magnet, an ore of iron in the lowest state of oxidation,
   which has the power of attracting metallic iron, as iron filings, and
   of communicating to masses of iron the same property of attraction,
   forming artificial magnets. [See Lodestone.]

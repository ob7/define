   CORRODE, v.t. [L., to eat or gnaw.]

   1. To eat away by degrees; to wear away, or diminish, by gradually
   separating small particles from a body, in the manner an animal gnaws a
   substance. Thus, nitric acid corrodes copper.

   2. To wear away by degrees; to prey upon; to impair; to consume, or
   diminish by slow degrees. Jealousy and envy corrode the constitution.
   Substances are corroded by time. The anxious man is a victim to
   corroding care.

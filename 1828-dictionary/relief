   RELIE'F, n.

   1. The removal, in whole or in part, of any evil that afflicts the body
   of mind; the removal or alleviation of pain, grief, want, care,
   anxiety, toil or distress, or of any thing oppressive or burdensome, by
   which some ease is obtained. Rest gives relief to the body when weary;
   an anodyne gives relief from pain; the sympathy of friends affords some
   relief to the distressed; a loan of money to a man embarrassed may
   afford him a temporary relief; medicines which will not cure a disease,
   sometimes give a partial relief. A complete relief from the troubles of
   life is never to be expected.

   2. That which mitigates or removes pain, grief or other evil.

   3. The dismission of a sentinel from his post, whose place is supplied
   by another soldier; also, the person who takes his place.

   4. In sculpture, &c. the projecture or prominence of a figure above or
   beyond the ground or plane on which it is formed. Relief is of three
   kinds; high relief [alto relievo;] low relief [basso relievo;] and demi
   relief [demi relievo.] The difference is in the degree of projecture.
   High relief is formed from nature, as when a figure projects as much as
   the life. Low relief is when the figure projects but little, as in
   medals, festoons, foliages and other ornaments. Demi relief is when one
   half of the figure rises from the plane.

   5. In painting, the appearance of projection, or the degree of boldness
   which a figure exhibits to the eye at a distance.

   6. In feudal law, a fine or composition which the heir of a tenant,
   holding by knight's service or other tenure, paid to the lord at the
   death of the ancestor, for the privilege of taking up the estate which,
   on strict feudal principles, had lapsed or fallen to the lord on the
   death of the tenant. This relief consisted of horses, arms, money and
   the like, the amount of which was originally arbitrary, but afterwards
   fixed at a certain rate by law. It is not payable, unless the heir at
   the death of his ancestor had attained to the age of twenty one years.

   7. A remedy, partial or total, for any wrong suffered; redress;
   indemnification. He applied to chancery, but could get no relief. He
   petitioned the legislature and obtained relief.

   8. The exposure of any thing by the proximity of something else.

   OPINION, n. opin'yon. [L. opinio, from opinor, to thing, Gr., L.
   suppono.]

   1. The judgment which the mind forms of any proposition, statement,
   theory or event, the truth or falsehood of which is supported by a
   degree of evidence that renders it probably, but does not produce
   absolute knowledge or certainty. It has been a received opinion that
   all matter is comprised in four elements. This opinion is proved by
   many discoveries to be false. From circumstances we form opinions
   respecting future events.

   Opinion is when the assent of the understanding is so far gained by
   evidence of probability, that it rather inclines to one persuasion than
   to another, yet not without a mixture of uncertainty or doubting.

   2. The judgment or sentiments which the mind forms of persons or their
   qualities. We speak of a good opinion, a favorable opinion, a bad
   opinion, a private opinion, and public or general opinion, &c.

   Friendship gives a man a peculiar right and claim to the good opinion
   of his friend.

   3. Settled judgment or persuasion; as religious opinions; political
   opinion.

   4. Favorable judgment; estimation.

   In actions of arms, small matters are of great moment, especially when
   they serve to raise an opinion of commanders.

   However, I have no opinion of these things -

[1]eternity

   ETER'NITY, n. [L. oeternitas.] Duration or continuance without
   beginning or end.

   By repeating the idea of any length of duration, with the endless
   addition of number, we come by the idea of eternity.

   The high and lofty one who inhabiteth eternity. Is.57.

   We speak of eternal duration preceding the present time. God has
   existed from eternity. We also speak of endless or everlasting duration
   in future, and dating from present time or the present state of things.
   Some men doubt the eternity of future punishment, though they have less
   difficulty in admitting the eternity of future rewards.

   ADESSENA'RIANS, n. [L. adesse, to be present.]

   In church history, a sect who hold the real presence of Christ's body
   in the eucharist, but not by transubstantiation. They differ however as
   to this presence; some holding the body of Christ to be in the bread;
   others, about the bread.

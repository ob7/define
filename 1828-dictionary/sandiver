   SAN'DIVER, n.

   Glass-gall; a whitish salt which is cast up from the materials of glass
   in fusion, and floating on the top, is skimmed off. A similar substance
   is thrown out in eruptions of volcanoes. It is used by gilders of iron,
   and in the fusion of certain ores. It is said to be good for cleansing
   the skin, and taken internally, is detergent.

   SCOTCH, v.t.

   To support, as a wheel, by placing some obstacle to prevent its
   rolling. Our wagoners and cartmen scot the wheels of their wagons and
   carts, when in ascending a hill they stop to give their team rest, or
   for other purpose. In Connecticut, I have generally heard this word
   pronounced scot, in Massachusetts, scotch.

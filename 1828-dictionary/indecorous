   INDEC'OROUS, a. [L. indecorus; in and decor, decus, deceo, to become.]
   Unbecoming; violating good manners; contrary to the established rules
   of good breeding, or to the forms of respect which age and station
   require. It is indecorous in a young person to take the highest place
   in company, when his superiors are present. Indecorous is sometimes
   equivalent to indecent; but it is less frequently applied to actions
   which offend modesty and chastity.

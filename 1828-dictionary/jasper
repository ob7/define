   J`ASPER, n. [L. iaspis.] A mineral of the siliceous kind, and of
   several varieties. It is less hard than flint or even than common
   quartz, but gives fire with steel. It is entirely opake, or sometimes
   feebly translucent at the edges, and it presents almost every variety
   of color. Its varieties are common jasper, striped jasper, Egyptian
   jasper, &c. It admits of an elegant polish, and is used for vases,
   seals, snuff-boxes, &c.

   Jasper is a subspecies of rhomboidal quartz, of five kinds, Egyptian,
   striped, porcelain, common, and agate jasper.

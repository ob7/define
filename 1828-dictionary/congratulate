[1]congratulate

   CONGRATULATE, v.t. [L., grateful, pleasing. See Grace.] To profess ones
   pleasure or joy to another on account of an event deemed happy or
   fortunate, as on the birth of a child, success in an enterprise,
   victory, escape from danger, &c.; to wish joy to another. We
   congratulate the nation on the restoration of peace.

   Formerly this verb was followed by to. The subjects of England may
   congratulate to themselves. But this use of to is entirely obsolete.
   The use of with after this verb, I congratulate with my country, is
   perhaps less objectionable, but is rarely used. The intransitive sense
   of the verb may therefore be considered as antiquated, and no longer
   legitimate.

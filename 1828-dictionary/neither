[1]neither

   NEITHER, n. [Compound pronoun, pronominal adjective, or a substitute,
   and not either, or not other. Not either; not the one nor the other.]

   1. It refers to individual things or persons; as, which road shall I
   take? Neither, take neither road. The upright judge inclines to neither
   party. It is used as a substitute; as, the upright judge inclines to
   neither of the parties.

   He neither loves Nor either cares for him.

   2. It refers to a sentence; as, ye shall not eat of it, neither shall
   ye touch it. That is, ye shall not eat, not either or other shall ye
   touch it; ye shall not eat, nor shall ye do the other thing here
   mentioned, that is, touch it. Genesis 3.

   Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king; that is,
   fight not, either with small or great. 1 Kings 22.

   Neither, in the first part of a negative sentence, is followed by nor,
   in the subsequent part. It is neither the one nor the other. But or
   would be most proper, for the negative in neither, applies to both
   parts of the sentence. It is often used in the last member of a
   negative sentence instead of nor, as in the passage above cited. Ye
   shall not eat it , neither shall ye touch it. Here neither is
   improperly used for nor, for not in the first clause refers only to
   that clause, and the second negative refers only to the second clause.
   Ye shall not eat it, nor shall ye touch it. In the sentences above,
   neither is considered to be a conjunction or connecting word, though in
   fact it is a pronoun or representative of a clause of a sentence.

   3. Neither primarily refers to two; not either of two. But by usage it
   is applicable to any number, referring to individuals separately
   considered. Five or ten persons being charged with a misdemeanor or
   riot, each may say, neither of us was present.

   4. Neither sometimes closes a sentence in a peculiar manner, thus, men
   come not to the knowledge of ideas thought to be innate, till they come
   to the use of reason; not then neither. That is not either when they
   come to the use of reason, or before. Formerly, in English, as in Greek
   and French, two negatives were used for one negation. But in such
   phrases as that above, good speakers now use either; nor then either.

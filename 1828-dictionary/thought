   THOUGHT, pret. and pp. of think; pronounced thaut.

   THOUGHT, a. thaut. [primarily the passive participle of think, supra.

   1. Properly, that which the mind thinks. Thought is either the act or
   operation of the mind, when attending to a particular subject or thing
   or it is the idea consequent on that operation.

    We say, a man's thoughts are employed on government, on religion, on
    trade or arts, or his thoughts are employed on his dress or his means
   of living. By this we mean that the mind is directed to that particular
   subject or object; that is, according to the literal import of the verb
     think, the mind, the intellectual part of man, is set upon such an
    object, it holds it in view or contemplation, or it extends to it, it
                              stretches to it.

   Thought cannot be superadded to matter, so as in any sense to render it
   true that matter can become cogitative.

   2. Idea; conception. I wish to convey my thoughts to another person. I
   employ words that express my thoughts, so that he may have the same
   ideas; in this case, our thoughts will be alike.

   3. Fancy; conceit; something framed by the imagination.

   Thoughts come crowding in so fast upon me, that my only difficulty is
   to choose or reject.

   4. Reflection; particular consideration.

   Why do you keep alone?

   Using those thoughts which should have died

   With them they think on.

   5. Opinion; judgment.

   6. Meditation; serious consideration.

   Proceeds from want of sense or want of thought.

   7. Design; purpose.

   All their thoughts are against me for evil. Ps.56. 33.

                                   Jer.29.

   8. Silent contemplation.

   9. Solicitude; care; concern.

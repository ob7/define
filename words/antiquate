   AN'TIQUATE, v.t. [L. antiquo. See Antiquary.]

   To make old, or obsolete; to make old in such a degree as to put out of
   use. Hence, when applied to laws or customs, it amounts to make void or
   abrogate.

   Christianity might reasonably introduce new laws and antiquate or
   abrogate old ones.

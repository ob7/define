   ITCH, n.

   1. A cutaneous disease of the human race, appearing in small watery
   pustules on the skin, accompanied with an uneasiness or irritation that
   inclines the patient to use friction. This disease is supposed by some
   authors to be occasioned by a small insect, a species of Acarus, as the
   microscope detects these insects in the vesicles. Others suppose the
   pustules only form a nidus for the insects. This disease is taken only
   by contact or contagion.

   2. The sensation in the skin occasioned by the disease.

   3. A constant teasing desire; as an itch for praise; an itch for
   scribbling.

                                 ITCH, v.i.

   1. To feel a particular uneasiness in the skin, which inclines the
   person to scratch the part.

   2. To have a constant desire or teasing inclination; as itching ears. 2

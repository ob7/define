   AP'PETITE, n. [L. appetitus, from appeto. See Appetence.]

   1. The natural desire of pleasure or good; the desire of gratification,
   either of the body or of the mind. Appetites are passions directed to
   general objects, as the appetite for fame, glory or riches; in
   distinction from passions directed to some particular objects, which
   retain their proper name, as the passion of love, envy or gratitude.
   Passion does not exist without an object; natural appetites exist
   first, and are then directed to objects.

   2. A desire of food or drink; a painful sensation occasioned by hunger
   or thirst.

   3. Strong desire; eagerness or longing.

   4. The thing desired.

   Power being the natural appetite of princes.

   Appetites are natural or artificial. Hunger and thirst are natural
   appetites; the appetites for olives, tobacco, snuff, &c. are
   artificial.

   In old authors, appetite is followed by to, but regularly it should be
   followed by for before the object, as an appetite for pleasure.

   To be given to appetite, is to be voracious or gluttonous. Prov. 23:2.

[1]sally

   SAL'LY, n. [See the Verb.] In a general sense, a spring; a darting or
   shooting. Hence,

   1. An issue or rushing of troops from a besieged place to attack the
   besiegers.

   2. A spring or darting of intellect, fancy or imagination; flight;
   sprightly exertion. We say, sallies of wit, sallies of imagination.

   3. Excursion from the usual track; range.

   He who often makes sallies into a country, and traverses it up and
   down, will know it better than one that goes always round in the same
   track.

   4. Act of levity or extravagance; wild gaiety; frolic; a bounding or
   darting beyond ordinary rules; as a sally of youth; a sally of levity.

   SAL'LY, v.i. [L. salio. Gr. to impel, to shoot. See Solar, from L. sol.

   1. To issue or rush out, as a body of troops from a fortified place to
   attack besiegers.

   AUG'ER, n.

   An instrument for boring large holes, chiefly used by carpenters,
   joiners, cabinet makers, wheelwrights and shipwrights. It consists of
   an iron blade, ending in a steel bit, with a handle placed at right
   angles with the blade. Augers, made with a straight channel or groove,
   in some places, are called pod-augers; the modern augers, with spiral
   channels, are called screw-augers.

[1]bottle

   BOT'TLE, n.

   1. A hollow vessel of glass, wood, leather or other material, with a
   narrow mouth, for holding and carrying liquors. The oriental nations
   use skins or leather for the conveyance of liquors; and of this kind
   are the bottles mentioned in scripture. "Put new wine into bottles." In
   Europe and America, glass is used for liquors of all kinds; and farmers
   use small cags or hollow vessels of wood. The small kinds of glass
   bottles are called vials or phials.

   2. The contents of a bottle; as much as a bottle contains; but from the
   size of bottles used for wine, porter and cyder, a bottle is nearly a
   quart; as a bottle of wine or a porter.

   3. A quantity of hay in a bundle; a bundle of hay.

    BOT'TLE, v.t. To put into bottles; as, to bottle wine or porter. This
              includes the stopping of the bottles with corks.

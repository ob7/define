   BOTANOM'ANCY, n. An ancient species of divination by means of plants,
   especially sage and fig leaves. Persons wrote their names and questions
   on leaves, which they exposed to the wind, and as many of the letters
   as remained in their places were taken up, and being joined together,
   contained an answer to the question.

[1]differential

   DIFFERENTIAL, a. An epithet applied to an infinitely small quantity, so
   small as to be less than any assignable quantity. This is called a
   differential quantity. The differential method is applied to the
   doctrine of infinitesimals, or infinitely small quantities, called the
   arithmetic of fluxions. It consists in descending from whole quantities
   to their infinitely small differences, and comparing them. Hence it is
   called the differential calculus, or analysis of infinitesimals.

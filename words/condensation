[1]condensation

   CONDENSATION, a. [L. See Condense.] The act of making more dense or
   compact; or the act of causing the parts that compose a body to
   approach or unite more closely, either by mechanical pressure, or by a
   natural process; the state of being condensed. Dew and clouds are
   supposed to be formed by the condensation of vapor. It is opposed to
   rarefaction and expansion. Condensation is applicable to any
   compressible matter; and from condensation proceeds increased hardness,
   solidity, and weight.

   VELOC'ITY, n. [L. velositas, from velox, swift, allied to volo, to
   fly.]

   1. Swiftness; celerity; rapidity; as the velocity of wind; the velocity
   of a planet or comet in its orbit or course; the velocity of a cannon
   ball; the velocity of light. In these phrases, velocity is more
   generally used than celerity. We apply celerity to animals; as, a horse
   or an ostrich runs with celerity, and a stream runs with rapidity or
   velocity; but bodies moving in the air or in etherial space, move with
   greater or less velocity, not celerity. This usage is arbitrary, and
   perhaps not universal.

   2. In philosophy, velocity is that affection of motion by which a body
   moves over a certain space in a certain time. Velocity is in direct
   proportion to the space over which a body moves. Velocity is absolute
   or relative; absolute, when a body moves over a certain space in a
   certain time; relative, when it has respect to another moving body.
   Velocity is also uniform or equal; or it is unequal, that is, retarded
   or accelerated.

   ARREST', v.t. [L. resto, to stop; Eng. to rest. See Rest.]

   1. To obstruct; to stop; to check or hinder motion; as, to arrest the

   2. To take, seize or apprehend by virtue of a warrant from authority;
   as, to arrest one for debt or for a crime.

                                 ARREST', n.

   1. The taking or apprehending of a person by virtue of a warrant from
   authority. An arrest is made by seizing or touching the body.

   2. Any seizure, or taking by power, physical or moral.

   3. A stop, hindrance or restraint.

   4. In law, an arrest of judgment is the staying or stopping of a
   judgment after verdict, for causes assigned. Courts have power to
   arrest judgment for intrinsic causes appearing upon the face of the
   record; as when the declaration varies from the original writ; when the
   verdict differs materially from the pleadings; or when the case laid in
   the declaration is not sufficient in point of law, to found an action
   upon. The motion for this purpose is called a motion in arrest of
   judgment.

   5. A mangy humor between the ham and pastern of the hind legs of a
   horse.

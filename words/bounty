[1]bounty

   BOUN'TY, n. [L.bonitas, from bonus, good.]

   1. Liberality in bestowing gifts and favors; generosity; munificence.
   The word includes the gift or favor and the kindness of disposition
   with which it is bestowed; or a favor bestowed with benevolent
   disposition. This distinguishes it from a mere gift. It is also
   observed by Johnson, that it differs from charity, as a present from an
   alms, in not being bestowed upon persons absolutely necessitous. This
   is often the case; but bounty includes charity, as the genus
   comprehends the species; charity however does not necessarily include
   bounty, for charity or an alms may be given with reluctance.

   The word may be used also for a free gift, 2 Bor.4.5' or a disposition
               to give, without the gift; goodness in general.

   2. A premium offered or given, to induce men to enlist into the public
   service; or to encourage any branch of industry, as husbandry,
   manufactures or commerce.

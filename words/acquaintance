   ACQUAI'NTANCE, n.

   1. Familiar knowledge; a state of being acquainted, or of having
   intimate or more than slight or superficial knowledge; as, I know the
   man, but have no acquaintance with him. Sometimes it denotes a more
   slight knowledge.

   2. A person or persons well known; usually persons we have been
   accustomed to see and converse with; sometimes, persons more slightly
   known.

   Lover and friend has thou put far from me and mine acquaintance into
   darkness. Ps. 88.

   My acquaintance are estranged from me. Job 19.

   Acquaintances, in the plural is used, as applied to individual persons
   known; but more generally, acquaintance is used for one or more.

   Acquaintant, in a like sense, is not used.

   WO, n. [G.]

   1. Grief; sorrow; misery; a heavy calamity.

   One who is past; and behold, there come two woes more hereafter.
   Revelations 9.

   They weep each others wo.

   2. A curse.

   Can there be a wo or curse in all the stores of vengeance, equal to the
   malignity of such a practice?

   3. Wo is used in denunciation, and in exclamations of sorrow.

   Wo is me; for I am undone. Isaiah 6.

   This is properly the Saxon dative, wo is to me.

   Wo worth the day. This is also the dative; wo be to the day.

   Wo is a noun, and if used as an adjective, it is improperly used. Wo to
   you that are rich. Wo to that man, by whom the offense cometh; that is,
   misery, calamity, be or will be to him.

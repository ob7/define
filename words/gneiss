[1]gneiss

   GNE'ISS, n. ne'is. In mineralogy, a species of aggregated rock,
   composed of quartz, feldspar and mica, of a structure more or less
   distinctly slaty. The layers, whether straight or curved, are
   frequently thick, but often vary considerably in the same specimen. It
   passes on one side into granite, from which it differs in its slaty
   structure, and on the other into mica slate. It is rich in metalic
   ores.

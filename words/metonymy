   MET'ONYMY, n. [Gr. over, beyond, and name.] In rhetoric, a trope in
   which one word is put for another; a change of names which have some
   relation to each other; as when we say, "a man keeps a good table."
   instead of good provisions. "We read Virgil." that is, his poems or
   writings. "They have Moses and the prophets," that is, their books or
   writings. A man has a clear head, that is, understanding, intellect; a
   warm heart, that is affections.

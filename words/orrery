   OR'RERY, n. A machine so constructed as to represent by the movements
   of its parts, the motions and phases of the planets in their orbits.
   This machine was invented by George Graham, but Rowley, a workman,
   borrowed one from him, and made a copy for the earl of Orrery, after
   whom it was named by Sir Richard Steele. similar machines are called
   also planetariums.

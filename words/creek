   CREEK, v.t. To make a harsh sharp noise. [See Creak.]

   CREEK, n. [See Crack.]

   1. A small inlet, bay or cove; a recess in the shore of the sea, or of
   a river.

   They discovered a certain creek with a shore. Acts 27.

   2. Any turn in winding.

   3. A prominence or jut in a winding coast. [This sense is probably not
   legitimate.]

   4. In some of the American States, a small river. This sense is not
   justified by etymology, but as streams often enter into creeks and
   small bays or form them, the name has been extended to small streams in
   general.

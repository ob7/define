[1]barque

   BARQUE, n. A small ship; but appropriately, a ship which carries three
   masts without a mizen top sail. The English mariners, in the coal
   trade, apply this name to a broadsterned ship without a figure-head.

   Water-barks, in Holland, are small vessels, for conveying fresh water
   from place to place, the hold of which is filled with water.

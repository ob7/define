   ENTREA'AT, v.t. [L. tracto, to handle, feel,treat, use,manage.]

   1. To ask earnestly; to beseech; to petition or pray with urgency; to
   supplicate; to solicit pressingly; to importune.

   Isaac entreated Jehovah for his wife. Gen. 25.

   2. To prevail on by prayer or solicitation. Hence in the passive form,
   to be prevailed on; to yield to entreaty.

   It were a fruitless attempt to appease a power, whom no prayers could
   entreat.

   3. To treat, in any manner; properly, to use or manage; but I believe,
   entreat is always applied to persons, as treat is to persons or things.
   Applied to persons, to entreat is to use, or to deal with; to manifest
   to others any particular deportment, good or ill.

   I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well. Jer.15.

   The Egyptians evil-entreated us. Deut.26.

   [In this application, the prefix en is now dropped, and treat is used.]

   4. To entertain; to amuse.

   5. To entertain; to receive.

   EARTH'NUT, n. The groundnut, or root of the Arachis; a small round bulb
   or knob, like a nut. This root or bulb is formed from the germen, which
   becomes a pod and is thrust into the ground by a natural motion of the
   stalk.

   It is properly the fruit of the plant, and differs from other fruit
   only in the circumstance of ripening in the earth.

   EARTH'NUT, n. The pignut, or bunium; a globular root, somewhat
   resembling in taste a chestnut, whence it is called bulbocastanum.

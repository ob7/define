   KNIGHT, n. nite.

   1. Originally, a knight was a youth, and young men being employed as
   servants, hence it came to signify a servant. But among our warlike
   ancestors, the word was particularly applied to a young man after he
   was admitted to the privilege of bearing arms. The admission to this
   privilege was a ceremony of great importance, and was the origin of the
   institution of knighthood. Hence, in feudal times, a knight was a man
   admitted to military rank by a certain ceremony. This privilege was
   conferred on youths of family and fortune, and hence sprung the
   honorable title of knight, in modern usage. A knight has the title of
   Sir.

   2. A pupil or follower.

   3. A champion.

   Knight of the post, a knight dubbed at the whipping post or pillory; a
                              hireling witness.

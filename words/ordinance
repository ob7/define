[1]ordinance

   OR'DINANCE, n.

   1. A rule established by authority; a permanent rule of action. An
   ordinance may be a law or statute of sovereign power. In this sense it
   is often used in the Scriptures. Ex. 15. Num. 10. Ezra 3. It may also
   signify a decree, edict or rescript, and the word has sometimes been
   applied to the statutes of Parliament, but these are usually called
   acts or laws. In the United States, it is never applied to the acts of
   Congress, or of a state legislature.

   2. Observance commanded.

   3. Appointment.

   4. Established rite or ceremony. Heb. 9. In this sense, baptism and the
   Lord's supper are denominated ordinances.

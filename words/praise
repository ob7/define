[1]praise

   PRAISE, n. s as z. [L. pretium.]

   1. Commendation bestowed on a person for his personal virtues or worthy
   actions, on meritorious actions themselves, or on any thing valuable;
   approbation expressed in words or song. Praise may be expressed by an
   individual, and in this circumstance differs from fame, renown, and
   celebrity, which are the expression of the approbation of numbers, or
   public commendation. When praise is applied to the expression of public
   approbation, it may be synonymous with renown, or nearly so. A man may
   deserve the praise of an individual, or of a nation.

   There are men who always confound the praise of goodness with the
   practice.

   2. The expression of gratitude for personal favors conferred; a
   glorifying or extolling.

   He hath put a new song into my mouth, even praise to our God. Ps.40.

   3. The object, ground or reason of praise.

   He is thy praise,and he is thy God. Deut.10.

                 PRAISE, v.t. [L. tollo, extollo; pretium.]

   actions.

   We praise not Hector, though his name we know

   Is great in arms; 'tis hard to praise a foe.

   perfections or excellent works.

[1]laziness

   LA'ZINESS, n. [from lazy.]

   1. The state or quality of being lazy; indisposition to action or
   exertion; indolence; sluggishness; heaviness in motion; habitual sloth.
   Laziness differs from idleness; the latter being a mere defect or
   cessation of action, but laziness is sloth, with natural or habitual
   disinclination to action.

   Laziness travels so slowly, that poverty soon overtakes him.

   2. Slowness; tardiness.

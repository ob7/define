[1]discerpible

   DISCERPIBLE, a. [L., to seize, to tear. In some dictionaries it is
   written discerptible, on the authority of Glanville and More; and error
   indeed, but of little consequence, as the word is rarely or never
   used.] That may be torn asunder; separable; capable of being disunited
   by violence.

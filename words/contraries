[1]contraries

   CONTRARIES, n. [See Contrary.] In logic, propositions which destroy
   each other, but of which the falsehood of one does not establish the
   truth of the other.

   If two universals differ in quality, they are contraries; as, every
   vine is a tree; no vine is a tree. These can never be both true
   together; but they may be both false.

[1]elecampane

   ELECAMPA'NE, n. [L. helenium, from Gr. which signifies this plant and a
   feast in honor of Helen. Pliny informs us that this plant was so called
   because it was said to have sprung from the tears of Helen. The past
   part of the word is from the Latin campana; inula campana.]

   A genus of plants, the Inula, of many species. The common elecampane
   has a perennial, thick, branching root, of a strong odor, and is used
   in medicine. It is sometimes called yellow star-wort. The Germans are
   said to candy the root, like ginger, calling it German spice.

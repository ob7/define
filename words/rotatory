[1]rotatory

   RO'TATORY, a. [from rotator.]

   1. Turning on an axis, as a wheel; rotary.

   2. Going in a circle; following in succession; as rotatory assemblies.

   [This word is often used, probably by mistake, for rotary. It may be
   regularly formed from rotator, but not with the exact sense in which it
   is used. With rotator for its original, it would signify causing rather
   than being in a circular motion. The true word is rotary.]

[1]carpenter

   CARPENTER, n. An artificer who works in timber; a framer and builder of
   houses, and of ships. Those who build houses are called
   house-carpenters, and those who build ships are called ship-carpenters.

   In New England, a distinction is often made between the man who frames,
   and the man who executes the interior wood-work of a house. The framer
   is the carpenter, and the finisher is called joiner. This distinction
   is noticed by Johnson, and seems to be a genuine English distinction.
   But in some other parts of America, as in New-York, the term carpenter
   includes both the framer and the joiner; and in truth both branches of
   business are often performed by the same person. The word is never
   applied, as in Italy and Spain, to a coach-maker.

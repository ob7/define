[1]purchase

   PUR'CHASE, v.t. [This word seems to be considered by Blackstone as
   formed from the L. perquisitio. This is an error. The word is from the
   root of chase; purchaser is to pursue to the end or object, and hence
   to obtain. In Law Latin, purchase, the noun, was written purchacium.
   The legal use of the word in obtaining writs, shows best its true
   origin; to purchase a writ, is to sue out a writ, that is, to seek it
   out; for sue, seek, and L. sequor, are all of one origin, and
   synonymous with chase.]

   1. In its primary and legal sense, to gain, obtain or acquire by any
   means, except by descent or hereditary right.

   for ready money or on credit.

   3. To obtain by an expense of labor, danger or other sacrifice; as, to
   purchase favor with flattery.

   4. To expiate or recompense by a fine or forfeit; as, to purchase out
   abuses with tears and prayer.

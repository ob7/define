[1]cartridge

   CARTRIDGE, n. [a corruption of cartouch.] A case of pasteboard or
   parchment, holding the charge of powder or powder and balls, for a
   cannon, mortar, musket or pistol. The cartridges for small arms,
   prepared for battle, contain the powder and ball; those for cannon and
   mortars are made of paste-board, or tin. Cartridges, without balls, are
   called blank cartridges.

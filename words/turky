[1]turky

   TUR'KY, n. [As this fowl was not brought from Turkey, it would be more
   correct to write the name turky.] A large fowl, the Meleagris
   gallopavo, a distinct genus. It is a native of America, and its flesh
   furnishes most delicious food. Wild turkies abound in the forests of
   America, and domestic turkies are bred in other countries, as well as
   in America.

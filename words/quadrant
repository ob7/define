   QUAD'RANT, n. [L. quadrans, a fourth.]

   1. The fourth part; the quarter.

   2. In geometry, the quarter of a circle; the arc of a circle containing
   ninety degrees; also, the space or area included between this arc and
   two radii drawn from the center to each extremity.

   3. An instrument for taking the altitudes of the sun or stars, of great
   use in astronomy and navigation. Quadrants are variously made, but they
   all consist of the quarter of a circle whose limb is divided into
   ninety degrees; or, as in Hadley's reflecting quadrant, an arc of forty
   five degrees is made to serve the same purpose as an arc of ninety
   degrees.

   Quadrant of altitude, an appendage of the artificial globe, consisting
   of a slip of brass of the length of a quadrant of one of the great
   circles of the globe, and graduated. It is filled to the meridian and
   movable round to all points of the horizon. It serves as a scale in
   measuring altitudes, azimuths, &c.

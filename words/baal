   BA'AL, n. An idol among the ancient Chaldeans and Syrians, representing
   the sun. The word signifies also lord, or commander; and the character
   of the idol was varied by different nations, at different times. Thus
   Baal Berith is supposed to signify the Lord of the Covenant; Baal Peor,
   or rather Baal Phegor, the Lord of the dead. Ps. cvi, Baal Zebub, the
   god of flies, &c.

[1]pro

   PRO, a Latin and Greek preposition, signifying for, before, forth, is
   probably contracted from prod, coinciding with It. proda, a prow,
   prode, brave; having the primary sense of moving forward. See Prodigal.
   In the phrase, pro and con, that is, pro and contra, it answers to the
   English for; for and against.

   In composition, pro denotes fore, forth, forward.

   EQ'UITY, n. [L. oequitas, from oequus, equal, even, level.]

   1. Justice; right. In practice, equity is the impartial distribution of
   justice, or the doing that to another which the laws of God and man,
   and of reason, give him a right to claim. It is the treating of a
   person according to justice and reason.

   The Lord shall judge the people with equity. Ps.98.

   With righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity.
   Is.11.

   2. Justice; impartiality; a just regard to right or claim; as, we must,
   in equity, allow this claim.

   3. In law, an equitable claim. "I consider the wife's equity to be too
   well settled to be shaken."

   4. In jurisprudence, the correction or qualification of law, when too
   severe or defective; or the extension of the words of the law to cases
   not expressed, yet coming within the reason of the law. Hence a court
   of equity or chancery, is a court which corrects the operation of the
   literal text of the law, and supplies its defects, by reasonable
   construction, and by rules of proceeding and deciding, which are not
   admissible in a court of law. Equity then is the law of reason,
   exercised by the chancellor or judge, giving remedy in cases to which
   the courts of law are not competent.

   5. Equity of redemption, in law, the advantage, allowed to a mortgager,
   of a reasonable time to redeem lands mortgaged, when the estate is of
   greater value than the sum for which it was mortgaged.

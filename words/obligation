   OBLIGA'TION, n. [L. obligatio.]

   1. The binding power of a vow, promise, oath or contract, or of law,
   civil, political or moral, independent of a promise; that which
   constitutes legal or moral duty, and which renders a person liable to
   coercion and punishment for neglecting it. The laws and commands of God
   impose on us an obligation to love him supremely, and our neighbor as
   ourselves. Every citizen is under an obligation to obey the laws of the
   state. Moral obligation binds men without promise or contract.

   2. The binding force of civility, kindness or gratitude, when the
   performance of a duty cannot be enforced by law. Favors conferred
   impose on men an obligation to make suitable returns.

   3. Any act by which a person becomes bound to do something to or for
   another, or to forbear something.

   4. In law, a bond with a condition annexed and a penalty for
   non-fulfillment.

   limits its extent.

   two terms or boundaries.

   2. The time for which any thing lasts; any limited time; as the term of

   5. In law, the time in which a court is held or open for the trial of
   causes. In England,there are four terms in the year; Hilary term, from
   January 23d to February 12th; Easter term, from Wednesday, fortnight
   after Easter, to the Monday next after Ascension day; Trinity term,
   from Friday next after Trinity Sunday to the Wednesday, fortnight
   after; and Michaelmas term, from November 6th to the 28th. These terms
   are observed by the courts of king's bench, the common pleas and
   exchequer, but not by the parliament, the chancery or by inferior
   courts. The rest of the year is called vacation. In the United States,
   the terms to be observed by the tribunals of justice, are prescribed by
   the statutes of congress and of the several states.

   6. In universities and colleges, the time during which instruction is

   9. In logic, a syllogism consists of three terms, the major, the minor,
   and the middle. The predicate of the conclusion is called the major
   term, because it is the most general, and the subject of the conclusion
   is called the minor term, because it is less general. These are called
   the extremes; and the third term, introduced as a common measure
   between them, is called the mean or middle term. Thus in the following
   syllogism.

   Every vegetable is combustible;

   Every tree is vegetable;

   Therefore every tree is combustible.

   Combustible is the predicate of the conclusion, or the major term;
   every tree is the minor term; vegetable is the middle term.

    10. In architecture, a kind of statues or columns adorned on the top
    with the figure of a head, either of a man, woman or satyr. Terms are
   sometimes used as consoles, and sustain entablatures; and sometimes as
                          statues to adorn gardens.

     11. Among the ancients, terms, termini miliares, were the heads of
    certain divinities placed on square land-marks of stone, to mark the
      several stadia on roads. These were dedicated to Mercury, who was
                     supposed to preside over highways.

    12. In algebra, a member of a compound quantity; as a, in a+b; or ab,
                                  in ab+cd.

    14. In contracts, terms, in the plural, are conditions; propositions
   stated or promises made, which when assented to or accepted by another,
    settle the contract and bind the parties. A engages to build a house
      for B for a specific sum of money, in a given time; these are his
   terms. When B promises to give to A that sum for building the house, he
     has agreed to the terms; the contract is completed and binding upon
                                both parties.

      Terms of proportion, in mathematics, are such numbers, letters or
                quantities as are compared one with another.

                   To make terms, to come to an agreement.

            To come to terms, to agree; to come to an agreement.

        To bring to terms, to reduce to submission or to conditions.

[1]obstinacy

   OB'STINACY, n. [L. obstinatio, from obsto, to stand against, to oppose;
   ob and sto.]

   1. A fixedness in opinion or resolution that cannot be shaken at all,
   or not without great difficulty; firm and usually unreasonable
   adherence to an opinion, purpose or system; a fixedness that will not
   yield to persuasion, arguments or other means. Obstinacy may not always
   convey the idea of unreasonable or unjustifiable firmness; as when we
   say, soldiers fight with obstinacy. But often, and perhaps usually, the
   word denotes a fixedness of resolution which is not to be vindicated
   under the circumstances; stubbornness; pertinacity; persistency.

   2. Fixedness that will not yield to application, or that yields with
   difficulty; as the obstinacy of a disease or evil.

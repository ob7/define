   INDI'TE, v.t. [L. indico, indictum; in and dico, to speak.]

   1. To compose; to write; to commit to words in writing.

   2. To direct or dictate what is to be uttered or written. The late

                   INDI'TE, v.i. To compose an account of.

    [This is from the same original as indict. The different applications
       of the word have induced authors to express each in a different
                   orthography, but without good reason.]

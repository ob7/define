[1]escort

   ES'CORT, n. A guard; a body of armed men which attends an officer, or
   baggage; provisions or munitions conveyed by land from place to
   place,to protect them from an enemy, or in general, for security. [This
   word is rarely, and never properly used for naval protection or
   protectors; the latter we call a convoy. I have found it applied to
   naval protection, but it is unusual.]

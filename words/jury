[1]jury

   JU'RY, n. [L. juro, to swear.] A number of freeholders, selected in the
   manner prescribed by law, empaneled and sworn to inquire into and try
   any matter of fact, and to declare the truth on the evidence given them
   in the case. Grand juries consist usually of twenty four freeholders at
   least, and are summoned to try matters alleged in indictments. Petty
   juries, consisting usually of twelve men, attend courts to try matters
   of fact in civil causes, and to decide both the law and the fact in
   criminal prosecutions. The decision of a petty jury is called a
   verdict.

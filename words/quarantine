   QUAR'ANTINE, n. [L. quartus, fourth; Eng. quart. See Quart and Square.]

   1. Properly, the space of forty days; appropriately, the term of forty
   days during which a ship arriving in port and suspected of being
   infected with a malignant, contagious disease, is obliged to forbear
   all intercourse with the city or place. Hence,

   2. Restraint of intercourse to which a ship is subjected on the
   presumption that she may be infected, either for forty days or for any
   other limited term. It is customary for the proper officers to
   determine the period of restraint at their discretion, according to
   circumstances. Hence we hear of a quarantine of five days, of ten, of
   thirty, &c. as well as of forty. We say, a ship performs quarantine, or
   rides at quarantine. We also apply the word to persons. The passengers
   and crew perform quarantine.

   3. In law, the period of forty days, during which the widow of a man
   dying seized of land, has the privilege of remaining to the mansion
   house.

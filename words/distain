   DISTAIN, v.t. [dis and stain. L. See Stain.]

   1. To stain; to tinge with any different color from the natural or
   proper one; to discolor. We speak of a sword distained with blood; a
   garment distained with gore. It has precisely the signification of
   stain, but is used chiefly or appropriately in poetry and the higher
   kinds of prose.

   2. To blot; to sully; to defile; to tarnish.

   She distained her honorable blood.

   The worthiness of praise distains his worth.

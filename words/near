[1]near

   NEAR, a. [This seems to be a contracted word, from nigher, the
   comparative of neh, nih or nieh; strait, narrow; to narrow]

   should be followed by to, but this is often omitted. We say, a house
   stands near a river; a friend sits near me; the man fell and was near
   destruction.

   And Jacob went near to Isaac his father. Genesis 27.

   Now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. Romans 13.

   2. Closely related by blood.

   She is thy fathers near kinswoman. Leviticus 18.

   3. Not distant in affection, support or assistance; present; ready;
   willing to aid.

   Call upon the Lord, while he is near. Isaiah 55.

   4. Intimate; united in close ties of affection or confidence; as a near
   friend.

   5. Dear; affecting ones interest or feelings; as a near concern.

   My nearest life.

   TACK, v.t. [Gr. to set,place, ordain.]

   1. To fasten; to attach. In the solemn or grave style, this word now
   appears ludicrous; as, to get a commendam tacked to their sees.

   --And tack the center to the sphere.

   2. To unite by stitching together; as, to tack together the sheets of a
   book; to tack one piece of cloth to another. [In the familiar style,
   this word is in good use.]

   3. To fasten slightly by nails; as, to tack on a board or shingle.

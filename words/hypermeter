[1]hypermeter

   HYPER'METER, n. [Gr. beyond, and measure.] Anything greater than the
   ordinary standard of measure.

   A verse is called a hypermeter, when it contains a syllable more than
   the ordinary measure. When this is the case, the following line begins
   with a vowel, and the redundant syllable of the former line blends with
   the first of the following, and they are read as one syllable.

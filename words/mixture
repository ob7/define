   MIX'TURE, n. [L. mixtura.] The act of mixing, or state of being mixed.
   Compounds are made by the mixture of different substances.

   1. A mass or compound, consisting of different ingredients blended
   without order. In this life there is a mixture of good and evil. Most
   wines in market are base mixtures.

   2. The ingredient added and mixed. Cicero doubted whether it is
   possible for a community to exist without a prevailing mixture of piety
   in its constitution.

   3. In pharmacy, a liquid medicine which receives into its composition
   not only extracts, salts and other substances dissolvable in water, but
   earths, powders and other substances not dissolvable.

   4. In chimistry, mixture differs from combination. In mixture, the
   several ingredients are blended without an alteration of the
   substances, each of which still retains its own nature and properties.
   In combination, the substances unite by chimical attraction, and losing
   their distinct properties, they form a compound differing in its
   properties from either of the ingredients.

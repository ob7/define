[1]mettle

   METTLE, n. met'l. [usually supposed to be corrupted from metal.

   L. animus, animosus.] Spirit; constitutional ardor; that temperament
   which is susceptible of high excitement. It is not synonymous with
   courage, though it may be accompanied with it, and is sometimes used
   for it.

   The winged courser, like a generous horse,

   Shows most true mettle when you check his course.

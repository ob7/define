   CREW, n.

   1. A company of people associated; as a noble crew; a gallant crew.

   2. A company, in a low or bad sense, which is now most usual; a herd;
   as a rebel crew.

   So we say, a miserable crew.

   3. The company of seamen who man a ship, vessel or boat; the company
   belonging to a vessel. Also, the company or gang of a carpenter,
   gunner, boatswain, &c. It is appropriated to the common sailors.

    CREW, pret. of crow, but the regular preterit and participle, crowed,
                         is now most commonly used.

[1]pole-axe

   PO'LE-AXE, n. An ax fixed to a pole or handle; or rather a sort of
   hatchet with a handle about fifteen inches in length, and a point or
   claw bending downward from the back of its head. It is principally used
   in actions at sea, to cut away the rigging of the enemy attempting to
   board; sometimes it is thrust into the side of a ship to assist in
   mounting the enemy's ship, and it is sometimes called a boarding-ax.

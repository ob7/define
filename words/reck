   RECK, v.i. [L. rego. See Rack and Reckon.]

   To care; to mind; to rate at much; as we say, to reckon much of;
   followed by of. Obs.

   Thou's but a lazy loorde, and recks much of thy swinke.

   I reck as little what betideth me, as much I wish all good befortune
   you.

   Of night or loneliness it recks me not.

                 RECK, v.t. To heed; to regard; to care for.

   This son of mine not recking danger.

   [This verb is obsolete unless in poetry. We observe the primary sense
   and application in the phrase, "it recks me not," that is, it does not
   strain or distress me; it does not rack my mind. To reck danger is a
   derivative form of expression, and a deviation from the proper sense of
   the verb.]

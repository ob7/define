   ASSUMP'SIT, n. [L. assumo.]

   1. In law, a promise or undertaking, founded on a consideration. This
   promise may be verbal or written; An assumpsit is express or implied;
   express, when made in words of writing; implied, when in consequence of
   some benefit or consideration accruing to one person from the acts of
   another, the law presumes that person has promised to make
   compensation. In this case, the law, upon a principle of justice,
   implies or raises a promise, on which an action may be brought to
   recover the compensation. Thus if A contracts with B to build a house
   for him, by implication and intendment of law, A promises to pay B for
   the same, without any express words to that effect.

   2. An action founded on a promise. When this action is brought on a
   debt, it is called indebitatus assumpsit, which is an action on the
   case to recover damages for the non-payment of a debt.

[1]set-off

   SET'-OFF, n. [set and off.] The act of admitting one claim to
   counterbalance another. In a set-off the defendant acknowledges the
   justice of the plantif's demand, but sets up a demand of his own to
   counter balance it in whole or in part.

   The right of pleading a set-off depends on statute. Blackstone.

   NOTE.- In new England, offset is sometimes used for set-off. But offset
   has a different sense, and it is desirable that the practice should be
   uniform, Wherever the English is spoken.

   TWIN'KLE, v.i.

   1. To sparkle; to flash at intervals; to shine with a tremulous
   intermitted light, or with a broken quivering light. The fixed stars
   twinkle; the planets do not.

   These stars do not twinkle, when viewed through telescopes that have
   large apertures.

   2. To open and shut the eye by turns; as the twinkling owl.

   3. To play irregularly; as, her eyes will twinkle.

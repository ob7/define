[1]object

   OB'JECT, n. [L. objectum, objectus. See the Verb.]

   1. That about which any power or faculty is employed, or something
   apprehended or presented to the mind by sensation or imagination. Thus
   that quality of a rose which is perceived by the sense of smell, is an
   object of perception. When the object is not in contact with the organ
   of sense, there must be some medium through which we obtain the
   perception of it. The impression which objects make on the senses, must
   be by the immediate application of them to the organs of sense, or by
   means of the medium that intervenes between the organs and the objects.

   2. That to which the mind is directed for accomplishment or attainment;
   end; ultimate purpose. Happiness is the object of every man's desires;
   we all strive to attain that object. Wealth and honor are pursued with
   eagerness as desirable objects.

   3. Something presented to the senses or the mind, to excite emotion,
   affection or passion.

   This passenger felt some degree of concern at the sight of so moving an
   object.

   In this sense, the word uttered with a particular emphasis, signifies
   something that may strongly move our pity, abhorrence or disgust. What
   an object!

   4. In grammar, that which is produced, influenced or acted on by
   something else; that which follows a transitive verb. When we say, "God
   created the world," world denotes the thing produced, and is the object
   after the verb created. When we say, "the light affects the eye," eye
   denotes that which is affected or acted on. When we say, "instruction
   directs the mind or opinions," mind and opinions," mind and opinions
   are the objects influenced.

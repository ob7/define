   MAINPERN'OR, n. In law, a surety for a prisoner's appearance in court
   at a day. Mainpernors differ from bail, in that a man's bail may
   imprison or surrender him before the stipulated day of appearance;
   mainpernors can do neither; they are bound to produce him to answer all
   charges whatsoever.

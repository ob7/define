[1]influence

   IN'FLUENCE, n. [L. influens, influo, to flow in; in and fluo, to flow.]
   Literally, a flowing in, into or on, and referring to substances
   spiritual or too subtil to be visible, like inspiration. Hence the word
   was formerly followed by into.

   God hath his influence into the very essence of all things.

                      It is not followed by on or with.

   1. In a general sense, influence denotes power whose operation is
   invisible and known only by its effects, or a power whose cause and
   operation are unseen.

   2. The power which celestial bodies are supposed to exert on
   terrestrial; as the influence of the planets on the birth and fortunes
   of men; an exploded doctrine of astrology.

   3. Moral power; power of truth operating on the mind, rational
   faculties or will, in persuading or dissuading, as the influence of
   motives, of arguments,or of prayer. We say, arguments had no influence
   on the jury. The magistrate is not popular; he has no influence with
   the people; or he has great influence with the prince.

   4. Physical power; power that affects natural bodies by unseen
   operation; as, the rays of the sun have an influence in whitening
   cloth, and in giving a green color to vegetables.

   5. Power acting on sensibility; as the influence of love or pity in
   sympathy.

   6. Spiritual power, or the immediate power of God on the mind; as
   divine influence; the influences of the Holy Spirit.

   IN'FLUENCE, v.t. To move by physical power operating by unseen laws or
                              force; to affect.

   These experiments succeed after the same manner in vacuo, as in the
   open air, and therefore are not influenced by the weight or pressure of
   the atmosphere.

   1. To move by moral power; to act on and affect, as the mind or will,
   in persuading or dissuading; to induce. Men are influenced by motives
   of interest or pleasure. An orator may influence the people to take
   arms, or to abandon an enterprise.

   2. To move, as the passions, as, to influence one by pity.

   3. To lead or direct. This revelation is sufficient to influence our
   faith and practice.

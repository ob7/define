[1]heliacal

   HELI'ACAL, a. [L. heliacus; Gr. the sun.]

   Emerging from the light of the sun, or passing into it. The heliacal
   rising of a star, is when, after being in conjunction with it and
   invisible, it emerges from the light so as to be visible in the morning
   before sunrising. On the contrary, the heliacal setting of a star, is
   when the sun approaches so near as to render it invisible by its
   superior splendor.

[1]prosperity

   PROSPER'ITY, n. [L. prosperitas.] Advance or gain in any thing good or
   desirable; successful progress in any business or enterprise; success;
   attainment of the object desired; as the prosperity of arts;
   agricultural or commercial prosperity; national prosperity. Our
   disposition to abuse the blessings of providence renders prosperity
   dangerous.

   The prosperity of fools shall destroy them. Prov.1.

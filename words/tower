   TOW'ER, n. [L. turris.]

   1. A building, either round or square, raised to a considerable
   elevation and consisting of several stories. When towers are erected
   with other buildings, as they usually are, they rise above the main
   edifice. They are generally flat on the top, and thus differ from
   steeples or spires. Before the invention of guns, places were fortified
   with towers and attacked with movable towers mounted on wheels, which
   placed the besiegers on a level with the walls.

   2. A citadel; a fortress. Ps.61.

   3. A high head dress.

   4. High flight; elevation.

       Tower bastion, in fortification, a small tower in the form of a
          bastion, with rooms or cells underneath for men and guns.

    Tower of London, a citadel containing an arsenal. It is also a palace
              where the kings of England have sometimes lodged.

          TOW'ER, v.i. To rise and fly high; to soar; to be lofty.

   Sublime thoughts, which tower above the clouds.

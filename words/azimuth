   through the center of the object.

   2. Magnetical azimuth, an arch of the horizon, intercepted between the
   azimuth or vertical circle, passing through the center of any heavenly
   body, and the magnetic meridian. This is found by observing the object
   with an azimuth compass.

   3. Azimuth compass, an instrument for finding either the magnetic
   azimuth or amplitude of an heavenly object.

   4. Azimuth dial, a dial whose stile or gnomon is at right angles to the

   5. Azimuths or vertical circles, are great circles intersecting each

   On charts, these azimuths are represented by rhumbs, and on the globe,
   by the quadrant of altitude, when screwed in the zenith.

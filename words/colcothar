[1]colcothar

   COLCOTHAR, n. The brown red oxyd of iron which remains after the
   distillation of the acid from sulphate of iron; used for polishing
   glass and other substances. It is called by artists crocus, or crocus
   martis.

   The sulphate of iron is called colcothar or chalcite, when the
   calcination has been carried so far as to drive off a considerable part
   of the acid.

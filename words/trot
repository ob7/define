   TROT, v.i.

   1. To move faster than in walking, as a horse or other quadruped, by
   lifting one fore foot and the hind foot of the opposite side at the
   same time.

   2. To walk or move fast; or to run.

   He that rises late must trot all day, and will scarcely overtake his
   business at night.

   TROT, n. The pace of a horse or other quadruped, when he lifts one fore
   foot and the hind foot of the opposite side at the same time. This pace
     is the same as that of a walk, but more rapid. The trot is often a
   jolting hard motion, but in some horses, it is as easy as the amble or
                  pace, and has a more stately appearance.

   1. An old woman; in contempt.

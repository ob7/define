   PRESUMP'TION, n. [L. proesumption.]

   1. Supposition of the truth or real existence of something without
   direct or positive proof of the fact, but grounded on circumstantial or
   probable evidence which entitles it to belief. Presumption in law is of
   three sorts, violent or strong, probable, and light.

   Next to positive proof, circumstantial evidence or the doctrine of
   presumptions must take place; for when the fact cannot be
   demonstratively evinced, that which comes nearest to the proof of the
   fact is the proof of such circumstances as either necessarily or
   usually attend such facts. These are called presumptions. Violent
   presumption is many times equal to full proof.

   2. Strong probability; as in the common phrase, the presumption is that
   an event has taken place, or will take place.

   3. Blind or headstrong confidence; unreasonable adventurousness; a
   venturing to undertake something without reasonable prospect of
   success, or against the usual probabilities of safety;
   presumptuousness.

   Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath.

   I had the presumption to dedicate to you a very unfinished price.

   4. Arrogance. He had the presumption to attempt to dictate to the
   council.

   5. Unreasonable confidence in divine favor.

   The awe of his majesty will keep us from presumption.

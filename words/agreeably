[1]agreeably

   AGREE'ABLY, adv.

   1. Pleasingly; in an agreeable manner; in a manner to give pleasure;
   as, to be agreeably entertained with a discourse.

   2. Suitably; consistently; conformably;

   The effect of which is, that marriages grow less frequent, agreeably to
   the maxim above laid down.

   This is a gross error, proceeding from mistake. Agreeably signifies, in
   an agreeable manner; but this is not the sense, nor does the word
   modify the verb grow. The sense is, marriages grow less frequent, which
   [fact, or whole member of the sentence, or proposition] is agreeable to
   the maxim above laid down. This use of agreeably is common, but grossly
   erroneous.

   3. Alike; in the same manner.

   Both armed agreeably. Obs.

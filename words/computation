   COMPUTATION, n. [L., See Compute.]

   1. The act of computing, numbering, reckoning or estimating; the
   process by which different sums or particulars are numbered, estimated,
   or compared, with a view to ascertain the amount, aggregate, or other
   result depending on such sums or particulars. We find by computation
   the quantity of provisions necessary to support an army for a year, and
   the amount of money to pay them; making the ration and pay of each man
   the basis of the computation. By computations of time or years, we
   ascertain the dates of events.

   2. The sum, quantity or amount ascertained by computing, or reckoning.

   We pass for women of fifty; many additional years are thrown into
   female computations of this nature.

   3. Calculation.

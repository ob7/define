   SE'ZIN, n.

   1. In law, possession. Seizin is of two sorts, seizin in deed or fact,
   and seizin in law. Seizin in fact or deed, is actual or corporal
   possession; seizin in law, is when something is done in which the law
   accounts possession or seizin, as enrollment, or when lands decend to
   an heir, but he has not yet entered on them. In this case, the law
   considers the heir as seized of the setate, and the person who
   wrongfully enters on the land is accounted a disseizor.

   2. The act of taking possession. [Not used except in law.]

   3. The thing possessed; possession.

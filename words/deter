   DETER, v.t. [L., to frighten.]

   1. To discourage and stop by fear; to stop or prevent from acting or
   proceeding, by danger, difficulty or other consideration which
   disheartens, or countervails the motive for an act. We are often
   deterred from out duty by trivial difficulties. The state of the road
   or a cloudy sky may deter a man from undertaking a journey.

   A million of frustrated hopes will not deter us from new experiments.

   2. To prevent by prohibition or danger.

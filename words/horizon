[1]horizon

   HOR'IZON, n. [Gr. to bound, a limit.] The line that terminates the
   view, when extended on the surface of the earth; or a great circle of
   the sphere, dividing the world into two parts or hemispheres; the upper
   hemisphere which is visible, and the lower which is hid. The horizon is
   sensible,and rational or real. The sensible, apparent, or visible
   horizon, is a lesser circle of the sphere, which divides the visible
   part of the sphere from the invisible. It is eastern or western; the
   eastern is that wherein the sun and stars rise; the western, that
   wherein they set. The rational, true, or astronomical horizon, is a
   great circle whose plane passes through the center of the earth, and
   whose poles are the zenith and nadir. This horizon would bound the
   sight, if the eye could take in the whole hemisphere.

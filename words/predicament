[1]predicament

   PREDIC'AMENT, n. [L. proedicamentum, from proedico, to affirm.]

   1. In logic, a category; a series or order of all the predicates or
   attributes contained under any genus. The school philosophers
   distribute all the objects of our thoughts and ideas into genera or
   classes, which the Greeks call categories, and the Latins predicaments.
   Aristotle made ten categories, viz. substance, quantity, quality,
   relation, action, passion, time, place, situation and habit.

   2. Class or kind described by any definite marks; hence, condition;
   particular situation or state.

   We say, the country is in a singular predicament.

[1]earnest

   EARNEST, a. ern'est.

   1. Ardent in the pursuit of an object; eager to obtain; having a
   longing desire; warmly engaged or incited.

   They are never more earnest to disturb us, than when they see us most
   earnest in this duty.

   2. Ardent; warm; eager; zealous; animated; importunate; as earnest in
   love; earnest in prayer.

   3. Intent; fixed.

   On that prospect strange

   Their earnest eyes were fixed.

   4. Serious; important; that is, really intent or engaged; whence the
   phrase, in earnest. To be in earnest, is to be really urging or
   stretching towards an object; intent on a pursuit. Hence, from fixed
   attention, comes the sense of seriousness in the pursuit, as opposed to
   trifling or jest. Are you in earnest or in jest?

    EARNEST, n. ern'est. Seriousness; a reality; a real event; as opposed
                      to jesting or feigned appearance.

   Take heed that this jest do not one day turn to earnest.

   And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.

   1. First fruits; that which is in advance, and gives promise of
   something to come. Early fruit may be an earnest of fruit to follow.
   The first success in arms may be an earnest of future success. The
   christian's peace of mind in this life is an earnest of future peace
   and happiness. Hence earnest or earnest-money is a first payment or
   deposit giving promise or assurance of full payment. Hence the practice
   of giving an earnest to ratify a bargain.

   This sense of the word is primary, denoting that which goes before, or
     in advance. Thus the earnest of the spirit is given to saints, as a
     pledge or assurance of their future enjoyment of God's presence and
                                   favor.

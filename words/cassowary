   CASSOWARY, n. A large fowl of the genus Struthio, nearly as large as
   the ostrich, but its legs are thicker and stronger in proportion. The
   wings are so small as not to appear, being hid under the feathers. The
   head is armed with a helmet of horny substance, consisting of plates
   one over another. It runs with great rapidity, outstripping the
   swiftest racer. It is now arranged in a separate genus, Casuarius.

[1]punctuation

   PUNCTUA'TION, n. In grammar, the act or art of pointing a writing or
   discourse, or the act or art of marking with points the divisions of a
   discourse into sentences and clauses or members of a sentence.
   Punctuation is performed by four points, the period (.); the colon (:);
   the semicolon ( ;); and the comma (,). The ancients were unacquainted
   with punctuation; they wrote without any distinction of members, period
   or words.

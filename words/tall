[1]tall

   TALL, a. [Eng. dally; L. tollo.]

   1. High in stature; long and comparatively slender; applied to a
   person, or to a standing tree, mast or pole. Tall always refers to
   something erect, and of which the diameter is small in proportion to
   the highth. We say, a tall man or woman, a tall boy for his age; a tall
   tree, a tall pole, a tall mast; but we never say, a tall house or a
   tall mountain. The application of the word to a palace or its shadow,
   in Waller, is now improper.

   Dark shadows cast, and as his palace tall.

   2. Sturdy; lusty; bold. [Unusual.]

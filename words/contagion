[1]contagion

   CONTAGION, n. [L., to touch.]

   1. Literally, a touch or touching. Hence, the communication of a
   disease by contact, or the matter communicated. More generally, that
   subtil matter which proceeds from a diseased person or body, and
   communicates the disease to another person; as in cases of small pox,
   measles, anginas, and malignant fevers; diseases which are communicated
   without contact. This contagion proceeds from the breath of the
   diseased, from the perspiration of other excretions.

   2. That which communicates evil from one to another; infection; that
   which propagates mischief; as the contagion of vice or of evil
   examples.

   3. Pestilence; a pestilential disease; venomous exhalations.

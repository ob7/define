   SURVI'VE, v.t. [L. supervivo.]

   1. To outlive; to live beyond the life of another; as,the wife survives
   her husband; or a husband survives his wife.

   2. To outlive any thing else; to live beyond any event. Who would wish
   to survive the ruin of his country? Many men survive their usefulness
   or the regular exercise of their reason.

                       SURVI'VE, v.i. To remain alive.

   Try pleasure,

   Which when no other enemy survives,

   Still conquers all the conquerors.

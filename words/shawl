[1]shawl

   SHAWL, n. A cloth of wool, cotton, silk or hair, used by females as a
   loose covering for the neck and shoulders. Shawls are of various sizes
   from that of a hankerchief to that of a counterpane. Shawls were
   originally manufactured in the heart of India from the fine silky wool
   of the Thibet sheep, and the best shawls now come from Cashmere; but
   they are also manufactured in Europe. The largest kinds are used in
   train-dresses and for long scarfs.

[1]satiety

   SATI'ETY, n. [L. satietas. See Sate.]

   Properly, fullness of gratification, either of the appetite or any
   sensual desire; but it usually implies fullness beyond desire; an
   excess of gratification which excites wearisomeness or lothing; state
   of being glutted.

   In all pleasures there is satiety.

   - But thy words, with grace divine imbu'd, bring to their sweetness no
   satiety.

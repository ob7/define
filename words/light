[1]light

   LIGHT, n. lite. [L. lux, light and luceo, to shine. Eng. luck, both in
   elements and radical sense.]

   1. That ethereal agent or matter which makes objects perceptible to the
   sense of seeing, but the particles of which are separately invisible.
   It is now generally believed that light is a fluid, or real matter,
   existing independent of other substances, with properties peculiar to
   itself. Its velocity is astonishing, as it passes through a space of
   nearly twelve millions of miles in a minute. Light, when decomposed, is
   found to consist of rays differently colored; as red, orange, yellow,
   green, blue, indigo, and violet. The sun is the principal source of
   light in the solar system; but light is also emitted from bodies
   ignited, or in combustion, and is reflected from enlightened bodies, as
   the moon. Light is also emitted from certain putrefying substances. It
   is usually united with heat, but it exists also independent of it.

   2. That flood of luminous rays which flows from the sun and constitutes
   day.

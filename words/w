[1]w

   W is the twenty third letter of the English Alphabet. It takes its
   written form and its name from the union of two Vs, this being the form
   of the Roman capital letter which we call U. The name, double u, being
   given to it from its form or composition, and not from its sound,
   especially the vowels. W is properly a vowel, a simple sound, formed by
   opening the mouth with a close circular configuration of the lips. it
   is precisely the ou of the French, and the u of the Spaniards, Italians
   and Germans. With the oter vowels it forms diphthongs, which are of
   easy pronunciation; as in well, want, will, dwell; pronouced ooell,
   ooant, ooill, dooell. In English, it is always followed by another
   vowel, except when followed by h, as is when; but this case is an
   exception only in writing, and not in pronunciation, for h precedes w
   in utterance; when being pronounced hooen. In Welsh, w, which is
   sounded as in English is used without another vowel, as in fwl, a fool;
   dwn, dun; dwb, mortar; gwn, a gun, and a gown.

   It is not improbable that the Romans pronouced v as we do w, for their
   volvo is our wallow; and volo, velle, is the English will, G. wollen.
   But this is uncertain.The German v has the sound of the English f, and
   w that of the English v.

   W, at the end of words is often silent after a and o, as in law, saw,
   low, sow. In many words of this kind, w represents the Saxon g; in
   other cases, it helps to form a diphthong, as in now, vow, new, strew.

[1]homicide

   HOM'ICIDE, n. [L. homicidium; homo, man, and caedo, to strike, to
   kill.]

   1. The killing of one man or human being by another. Homicide is of
   three kinds, justifiable, excusable, and felonious; justifiable, when
   it proceeds from unavoidable necessity, without an intention to kill,
   and without negligence; excusable, when it happens from misadventure,
   or in self-defense; felonious, when it proceeds from malice, or is done
   in the prosecution of some unlawful act, or in a sudden passion.
   Homicide committed with premeditated malice, is murder. Suicide also,
   or self-murder, is felonious homicide. Homicide comprehends murder and
   manslaughter.

   1. A person who kills another; a manslayer.

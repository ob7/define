   AXINOM'ANCY, n. [Gr. an ax, and divination.]

   Among the ancients, a species of divination, by means of an ax or
   hatchet, performed by laying an agate-stone on a red hot hatchet, or by
   fixing a hatchet on a round stake, so as to be poised; then the names
   of those suspected were repeated, and he at whose name the hatchet
   moved, was pronounced guilty.

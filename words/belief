   4. In some cases, the word is used for persuasion or opinion, when the
   evidence is not so clear as to leave no doubt; but the shades of
   strength in opinion can hardly be defined, or exemplified. Hence the
   use of qualifying words; as a firm, full or strong belief.

   5. The thing believed; the object of belief.

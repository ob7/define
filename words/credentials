   CREDENTIALS, n. plu. [Rarely or never used in the singular.] That which
   gives credit; that which gives a title or claim to confidence; the
   warrant on which belief, credit or authority is claimed, among
   strangers; as the letters of commendation and power given by a
   government to an embassador or envoy, which give him credit at a
   foreign court. So the power of working miracles given to the apostles
   may be considered as their credentials, authorizing them to propagate
   the gospel, and entitling them to credit.

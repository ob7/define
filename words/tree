   TREE, n.

   1. The general name of the largest of the vegetable kind, consisting of
   a firm woody stem springing from woody roots, and spreading above into
   branches which terminate in leaves. A tree differs from a shrub
   principally in size, many species of trees growing to the highth of
   fifty or sixty feet, and some species to seventy or eighty, and a few,
   particularly the pine, to a much greater highth.

   Trees are of various kinds; as nuciferous, or nut-bearing trees;
   bacciferous, or berry-bearing; coniferous, or cone-bearing, &c. Some
   are forest-trees, and useful for timber or fuel; others are fruit
   trees, and cultivated in gardens and orchards; others are used chiefly
   for shade and ornament.

   2. Something resembling a tree, consisting of a stem or stalk and
   branches; as a genealogical tree.

   3. In ship-building, pieces of timber are called chess-trees,
   cross-trees, roof-trees, tressel-trees, &c.

   4. In Scripture, a cross.

   --Jesus, whom they slew and hanged on a tree. Act.10.

   5. Wood.

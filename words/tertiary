[1]tertiary

   TER'TIARY, a. Third; of the third formation. Tertiary mountains are
   such as result from the ruins of other mountains promiscuously heaped
   together.

   Tertiary formation, in geology, a series of horizontal strata, more
   recent than chalk beds, consisting chiefly of sand and clay,and
   frequently embracing vast quantities of organic remains of the larger
   animals. It comprehends the alluvial formation, which embraces those
   deposits only which have resulted from causes still in operation; and
   the diluvial formation, which is constituted of such deposits as are
   supposed to have been produced by the deluge.

[1]moroseness

   MORO'SENESS, n. Sourness of temper; sullenness. Moroseness is not
   precisely peevishness or fretfulness, though often accompanied with it.
   It denotes more of silence and severity or ill humor, than the
   irritability or irritation which characterizes peevishness.

   Learn good humor, never to oppose without just reason; abate some
   degrees of pride and moroseness.

[1]holy

   HO'LY, a.

   1. Properly, whole, entire or perfect, in a moral sense. Hence, pure in
   heart, temper or dispositions; free from sin and sinful affections.
   Applied to the Supreme Being, holy signifies perfectly pure, immaculate
   and complete in moral character; and man is more or less holy, as his
   heart is more or less sanctified, or purified from evil dispositions.
   We call a man holy,when his heart is conformed in some degree to the
   image of God, and his life is regulated by the divine precepts. Hence,
   holy is used as nearly synonymous with good, pious, godly.

   Be ye holy; for I am holy. 1 pet.1.

   2. Hallowed; consecrated or set apart to a sacred use, or to the
   service or worship of God; a sense frequent in Scripture; as the holy

   priesthood.

   3. Proceeding from pious principles,or directed to pious purposes; as
   holy zeal.

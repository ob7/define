   DRAW-BRIDGE, n. A bridge which may be drawn up or let down to admit or
   hinder communication, as before the gate of a town or castle, or in a
   bridge over a navigable river. In the latter, the draw-bridge usually
   consists of two movable platforms, which may be raised to let a vessel
   pass through.

[1]condescension

   CONDESCENSION, n. Voluntary descent from rank, dignity or just claims;
   relinquishment of strict right; submission to inferiors in granting
   requests or performing acts which strict justice does not require.
   Hence, courtesy.

   It forbids pride and commands humility, modesty and condescension to
   others.

   Raphael, amidst his tenderness, shows such a dignity and condescension
   in all his behavior, as are suitable to a superior nature.

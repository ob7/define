   POLARIZA'TION, n. The act of giving polarity to a body.

   Polarization of light, a change produced upon light by the action of
   certain media, by which it exhibits the appearance of having polarity,
   or poles possessing different properties. This property of light was
   first discovered by Huygens in his investigation of the cause of double
   refraction, as seen in the Iceland crystal. The attention of opticians
   was more particularly directed towards it by the discoveries of Malus,
   in 1810. The knowledge of this singular property of light, has afforded
   an explanation of several very intricate phenomena in optics.

[1]olibanum

   OLIBA'NUM, n. [The word signifies then frankincense, and it is so named
   from its whiteness.]

   A gum-resin consisting of tears or drops, of a yellow transparent color
   and disagreeable smell. It is brought from Turkey and the East Indies.
   It is not, as Linne supposed, produced by the Juniperus Lycia, but from
   a different tree growing in Arabia and Hindoostan. In Arabia, luban is
   applied to benzoin, which is generally used for incense, and oliban is
   called condur, whence Gr. In medicine, it is used in fumigations as a
   resolvent.

   Thompson says olibanum is produced by different trees and in different
   countries.

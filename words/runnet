   RUN'NET, n.

   The concreted milk found in the stomachs of calves or other sucking
   quadrupeds. The same name is given to a liquor prepared by steeping the
   inner membrane of a calf's stomach in water, and to the membrane
   itself. This is used for coagulating milk, or converting it into curd
   in the making of cheese.

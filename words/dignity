   DIGNITY, n. [L., worthy.]

   1. True honor; nobleness or elevation of mind, consisting in a high
   sense of propriety, truth and justice, with an abhorrence of mean and
   sinful actions; opposed to meanness. In this sense, we speak of the
   dignity of mind, and dignity of sentiments. This dignity is based on
   moral rectitude; all vice is incompatible with true dignity of mind.
   The man who deliberately injures another, whether male or female, has
   no true dignity of soul.

   2. Elevation; honorable place or rank of elevation; degree of
   excellence, either in estimation, or in the order of nature. Man is
   superior in dignity to brutes.

   3. Elevation of aspect; grandeur of mein; as a man of native dignity.

   4. Elevation of deportment; as dignity of manners or behavior.

   5. An elevated office, civil or ecclesiastical, giving a high rank in
   society; advancement; preferment, or the rank attached to it. We say, a
   man enjoys his dignity with moderation, or without haughtiness. Among
   ecclesiastics, dignity is office or preferment joined with power or
   jurisdiction.

   6. The rank or title of a nobleman.

   7. In oratory, one of the three parts of elocution, consisting in the
   right use of tropes and figures.

   8. In astrology, an advantage which a planet has on account of its
   being in some particular place of the zodiac, or in a particular
   station in respect to other planets.

   9. A general maxim, or principle. [Not used.]

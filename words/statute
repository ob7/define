[1]statute

   STATUTE, [L., to set.]

   1. An act of the legislature of a state that extends its binding force
   to all the citizens or subjects of that state, as distinguished from an
   act which extends only to an individual or company; an act of the
   legislature commanding or prohibiting something; a positive law.
   Statutes are distinguished from common law. The latter owes its binding
   force to the principles of justice, to long use and the consent of a
   nation. The former owe their binding force to a positive command or
   declaration of the supreme power. Statute is commonly applied to the
   acts of a legislative body consisting of representatives. In
   monarchies, the laws of the sovereign are called edicts, decrees,
   ordinances, rescripts, &c.

   2. A special act of the supreme power, of a private nature, or intended
   to operate only on an individual or company.

   3. The act of a corporation or of its founder, intended as a permanent
   rule or law; as the statutes of a university.

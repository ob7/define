   AD'VENT, n. [L. adventus, from advenio, of ad and venio, to come. See
   Find.]

   A coming; appropriately the coming of our Savior, and in the calendar,
   it includes four sabbaths before Christmas, beginning of St. Andrew's
   Day, or on the sabbath next before or after it. It is intended as a
   season of devotion, with reference to the coming of Christ in the
   flesh, and his second coming to judge the world.

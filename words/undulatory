[1]undulatory

   UN'DULATORY, a. [from undulate. Moving in the manner of waves; or
   resembling the motion of waves, which successively rise or swell and
   fall. We speak of the undulatory motion of water, of air or other
   fluid, and this undulatory motion of air is supposed to be the cause of
   sounds. This is sometimes called vibratory; but undulatory seems to be
   most correct.

   PAL'SY, n. s as z. [supposed to be contracted from Gr. relaxation; to
   loosen or relax.] The loss or defect of the power of voluntary muscular
   motion in the whole body, or in a particular part; paralysis. When one
   side only of the body is affected, it is called hemiplegy. When the
   lower part of the body is paralytic, it is called paraplegy. Palsy may
   be a loss of the power of motion without a loss of sensation, or a loss
   of sensation without loss of motion, or a loss of both.

   COMEDY, n. A dramatic composition intended to represent human
   characters, which are to be imitated in language, dress and manner, by
   actors on a stage, for the amusement of spectators. The object of
   comedy is said to be to recommend virtue and make vice ridiculous; but
   the real effect is amusement.

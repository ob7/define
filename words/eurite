[1]eurite

   EU'RITE, n. The white stone [weiss stein] of Werner; a very
   small-grained granite, with the parts intimately blended, and hence
   often apparently compact. It is gray, red, &c., according to the color
   of the felspar, of which it is principally composed.

   Whitestone is a finely granular felspar, containing grains of quartz
   and scales of mica.

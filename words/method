   METH'OD, n. [L. methodus; Gr. with, and way.]

   1. A suitable and convenient arrangement of things, proceedings or
   ideas; the natural or regular disposition of separate things or parts;
   convenient order for transacting business, or for comprehending any
   complicated subject. Without method, business of any kind will fall
   into confusion. To carry on farming to advantage, to keep accounts
   correctly, method is indispensable.

   2. Way; manner. Let us know the nature of the disease, and the method
   of cure.

   3. Classification; arrangement of natural bodies according to their
   common characteristics; as the method of Theophrast; the method of Ray;
   the Linnean method.

   In natural arrangements a distinction is sometimes made between method
   and system. System is an arrangement founded, throughout all its parts,
       on some one principle. Method is an arrangement less fixed and
    determinate, and founded on more general relations. Thus we say, the
    natural method, and the artificial or sexual system of Linne, though
                     the latter is not a perfect system.

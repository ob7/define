   PORCH, n. [L. porticus, from porta, a gate, entrance or passage, or
   from portus, a shelter.]

   1. In architecture, a kind of vestibule supported by columns at the
   entrance of temples, halls, churches or other buildings.

   2. A portico; a covered walk.

   3. By way of distinction, the porch, was a public portico in Athens,
   where Zeno, the philosopher, taught his disciples. It was called the
   painted porch, from the pictures of Polygnotus and other eminent
   painters, with which it was adorned. Hence, the Porch is equivalent to
   the school of the Stoics.

   or does not produce it.

    Positively electrified, in the science of electricity. A body is said
    to be positively electrified or charged with electric matter, when it
    contains a superabundance of the fluid, and negatively electrified or
    charged, when some part of the fluid which it naturally contains, has
                             been taken from it.

   According to other theorists, when the electric fluid is directed
   outwards from a body,the substance is electrified positively; but when
   it is entering or has a tendency to enter another substance, the body
   is supposed to be negatively electrified. The two species of
   electricity attract each other, and each repels its own kind.

   ATH'ANOR, n. [Heb. thanor, an oven or furnace.]

   A digesting furnace, formerly used in chimical operations, so
   constructed as to maintain a uniform and durable heat. It is a furnace,
   with a lateral tower close on all sides, which is to be filled with
   fuel. As the fuel below is consumed, that in the tower falls down to
   supply its place.

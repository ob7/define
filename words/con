[1]con

   CON. A Latin inseparable preposition or prefix to other words.
   Ainsworth remarks that con and cum habe the same signification, but
   that cum is used separately, and con in composition. Con and cum may be
   radically distinct words. The Irish comh, or coimh, is equivalent to
   the Latin con; and the Welsh cym, convertible into cyv, appears to be
   the same word, denoting, says Owen, a mutual act, quality or effect. It
   is precisely equivalent to the Latin com, in comparo, compono, and the
   Latin com, in composition, may be the Celtic comh or cym. But generally
   it seems to be con, changed into com. Ainsworth deduces cum from the
   Greek; for originally it was written cyn. But this is probably a
   mistake.

   Con coincides in radical letters and in signification with the Teutonic
   gain, gen, gean, igen, igien, in the English again, against; Sax. Gean,
   ongean; sw. Igen; Dan. Igien. Whatever may be its origin or affinities,
   the primary sense of the word is probably from some root that signifies
   to meet or oppose, or turn and meet; to approach to, or to be with.
   This is the radical sense of most propositions of the like import. See
   the English with, again. So in Irish, coinne, a meeting; as coinne,
   opposite.

   Con, in compounds, is change into l before l, as in colligo, to
   collect, and into m before a labial, as in comparo, to compare. Before
   a vowel or h, the na is dropped; as in coalesco, to coalesce, to
   cooperate; cohibeo, to restrain. I denotes union, as in conjoin; or
   opposition, as in conflict, contend.

    CON, [abbreviated from Latin contra, against.] In the phrase, pro and
   con, for and against, con denotes the negative side of a question. As a
        noun, a person who is in the negative; as the pros and cons.

   CON, v.t. [to know, to be able, to be skillful or wise; and to bear or
     bring forth, Gr. To try, to attempt, to prove, L., whence cunning,
   skillful, experienced, or skill, experience; coincides in sense with to
   begin, to try to attempt. G. To know; to be able. The primary sense is,
    to strain or stretch, which gives the sense of strength, power, as in
      can, and of holding, containing, comprehending, as contain, from
    contineo, teneo, Gr., L. To beget or to bring forth. In the sense of
                  know, con signifies to hold or to reach.]

   1. To know.

   I conne no skill.

   I shall not conne answer. I shall not know or be able to answer.

   2. To make ones self master of; to fix in the mend or commit to memory;
   as, to con a lesson.

   To con thanks, to be pleased or obliged, or to thank.

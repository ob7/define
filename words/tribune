   TRIB'UNE, n. [L. tribunus, from tribus, tribe.]

   1. In ancient Rome, an officer or magistrate chosen by the people to
   protect them from the oppression of the patricians or nobles, and to
   defend their liberties against any attempts that might be made upon
   them by the senate and consuls. These magistrates were at first two,
   but their number was increased ultimately to ten. There were also
   military tribunes, officers of the army, each of whom commanded a
   division or legion. In the year of Rome 731, the senate transferred the
   authority of the tribunes to Augustus and his successors. There were
   also other officers called tribunes; as tribunes of the treasury, of
   the horse, of the making of arms, &c.

   2. In France, a pulpit or elevated place in the chamber of deputies,
   where a speaker stands to address the assembly.

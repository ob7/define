[1]topaz

   TO'PAZ, n. [Gr.] A mineral, said to be so called from Topazos, a small
   isle in the Arabic gulf, where the Romans obtained a stone which they
   called by this name, but which is the chrysolite of the moderns. The
   topaz is of a yellowish color. It sometimes occurs in masses, but more
   generally crystallized in rectangular octahedrons. Topaz is valued as a
   gem or precious stone, and is used in jewelry. It consists of silex,
   fluoric acid and alumin, in the following proportions; alumin 57 parts,
   silex 34, and fluoric acid 7 or 8.

   Of topaz there are three subspecies, common topaz, shorlite and
   physalite.

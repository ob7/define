   DIVINATION, n. [L., to foretell. See Divine.]

   1. The act of divining; a foretelling future events, or discovering
   things secret or obscure, by the aid of superior beings, or by other
   than human means. The ancient heathen philosophers divided divination
   into two kinds, natural and artificial. Natural divination was supposed
   to be effected by a kind of inspiration or divine afflatus; artificial
   divination was effected by certain rites, experiments or observations,
   as by sacrifices, cakes, flour, wine, observation of entrails, flight
   of birds, lots, verses, omens, position of the stars, &c.

   2. Conjectural presage; prediction.

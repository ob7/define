   COBBLE-STONE, n. A roundish stone; a pebble; supposed to be a fragment,
   rounded by the attrition of water. We give this name to stones of
   various sizes, from that of a hens egg or smaller, to that of large
   paving stones. These stones are called by the English copple-stones and
   bowlder-stones or bowlders. The latter name is among us known only in
   books.

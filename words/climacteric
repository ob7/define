   CLIMACTERIC, n. A critical period in human life, or a period in which
   some great change is supposed to take place in the human constitution.
   The critical periods are supposed by some persons to be the years
   produced by multiplying 7 into the odd numbers 3, 5, 7 and 9; to which
   others add the 81st year. The 63d year is called the grand climacteric.
   It has been supposed that these periods are attended with some
   remarkable change in respect o health, life or fortune.

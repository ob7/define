[1]regal

   RE'GAL, a. [L. regalis, from rex, L. rectus. See Reck and Reckon.]

   Pertaining to a king; kingly; royal; as a regal title; regal authority;
   regal state, pomp or splendor; regal power or sway. But we say, a royal
   or kingly government, not a regal one. We never say, a regal territory,
   regal dominions, regal army, or regal navy. Regal expresses what is
   more personal.

                      RE'GAL, n. A musical instrument.

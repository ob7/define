[1]pause

   PAUSE, n. paux. [L. pausa; Gr. to cease, or cause to rest.]

   1. A stop; a cessation or intermission of action, of speaking, singing,
   playing or the like; a temporary stop or rest.

   2. Cessation proceeding from doubt; suspense.

   I stand in pause where I shall first begin.

   3. Break or paragraph in writing.

   4. A temporary cessation in reading. The use of punctuation is to mark
   the pauses in writing. In verse, there are two kinds of pauses, the
   cesural and the final. The cesural pause divides the verse; the final
   pause closes it. The pauses which mark the sense, and which may be
   called sentential, are the same in prose and verse.

   5. A mark of cessation or intermission of the voice; a point.

    PAUSE, v.i. pauz. To make a short stop; to cease to speak for a time;
                       to intermit speaking or action.

   Pausing a while, thus to herself she mused.

   1. To stop; to wait; to forbear for a time.

   Tarry, pause a day or two,

   Before you hazard.

   2. To be intermitted. The music pauses.

                        To pause upon, to deliberate.

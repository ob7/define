[1]cockroach

   COCKROACH, n. A genus of insects, the Blatta, of several species. They
   have four semicrustaceous wings, and resemble the beetle; the head is
   inflected towards the breast; the feelers are hard like bristles; the
   elytra and wings are plain and resemble parchment. These animals are
   very troublesome, as they enter chests of clothes, meal-tubs, pantries,
   and infest beds. They avoid the light, and have a very unsavory smell.

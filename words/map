   the surface of the earth or of any part of it, drawn on paper or other
   material, exhibiting the lines of latitude and longitude,and the
   positions of countries, kingdoms, states, mountains, rivers, &c. A map
   of the earth, or of a large portion of it, comprehends a representation
   of land and water; but a representation of a continent or any portion
   of land only, is properly a map, and a representation of the ocean only
   or any portion of it, is called a chart. We say, a map of England, of
   France, of Europe; but a chart of the Atlantic, of the Pacific, &c.

   MAP, v.t. To draw or delineate, as the figure of any portion of land.

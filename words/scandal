   SCAN'DAL, n. [L. scandalum; Gr. In Greek, this word signifies a
   stumbling block, something against which a person impinges, or which
   causes him to fall.]

   1. Offense given by the faults of another.

   His lustful orgies he enlarg'd even to the hill of scandal.

   report; something uttered which is false and injurious to reputation.

   1. To treat opprobriously; to defame; to asperse; to traduce; to

   used.]

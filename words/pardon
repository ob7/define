[1]pardon

   P`ARDON, v.t. [L. per and dono, to give; per having the sense of the
   English for in forgive, and re in L. remitto, properly to give back or
   away.]

   1. To forgive; to remit; as an offense or crime. Guilt implies a being
   bound or subjected to censure, penalty or punishment. To pardon, is to
   give up this obligation, and release the offender. We apply the word to
   the crime or to the person. We pardon an offense, when we remove it
   from the offender and consider him as not guilty; we pardon the
   offender, when we release or absolve him from his liability to suffer
   punishment.

   I pray thee, pardon my sin. 1 Sam.15.

   2. To remit, as a penalty.

   I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it.

   3. To excuse, as for a fault.

   4. Pardon me, is a phrase used when one asks for excuse, or makes an
   apology, and it is often used in this sense, when a person means
   civilly to deny or contradict what another affirms.

   P`ARDON, n. Forgiveness; the release of an offense or of the obligation
   of the offender to suffer a penalty, or to bear the displeasure of the
       offended party. We seek the pardon of sins, transgressions and
                                  offenses.

   1. Remission of a penalty. An amnesty is a general pardon.

   2. Forgiveness received.

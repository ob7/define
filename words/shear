   SHEAR, v.t. pret. sheared; pp. sheared or shorn. The old pret. shore is
   entirely obsolete.

   1. To cut or clip something from the surface with an instrument of two
   blades; to separate any thing from the surface by shears, scissors or a
   like instrument; as, to shear sheep; to shear cloth. It is
   appropriately used for the cutting of wool from sheep on their skins,
   for clipping the nap from cloth, but may be applied to other things;
   as, a horse shears the ground in feeding much closer than an ox.

   2. To separate by shears; as, to shear a fleece.

   3. To reap. [Not in use.] Scotish.

   SHEAR, To deviate. [See Sheer.]

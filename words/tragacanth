   TRAG'ACANTH, n. [L. tragacanthum; Gr. a goat, and thorn.]

   1. Goat's thorn; a plant of the genus Astragalus, of several species,
   growing in Syria, Candia, &c. almost all of which were included by
   Linne in the tragacanthas, and all of which produce the gum tragacanth.

   2. A gum obtained from the goat's thorn. It comes in small contorted
   pieces resembling worms. It is of different colors; that which is
   white, clear, smooth and vermicular, is the best. It is somewhat soft
   to the touch, but only imperfectly soluble. It is softening, and used
   in coughs and catarrhs.

[1]prebendary

   PREB'ENDARY, n. An ecclesiastic who enjoys a prebend; the stipendiary
   of a cathedral church.

   A prebendary differs from a canon in this; the prebendary receives his
   prebend in consideration of his officiating in the church; the canon
   merely in consequence of his being received into the cathedral or
   college.

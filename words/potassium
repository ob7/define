[1]potassium

   POTAS'SIUM, n. A name given to the metallic basis of vegetable alkali.
   According to Dr. Davy, 100 parts of potash consist of 86.1 parts of the
   basis, and 13.9 of oxygen.

   Potassium has the most powerful affinity for oxygen of all substances
   known; it takes it from every other compound, and hence is a most
   important agent in chimical analysis.

   ROTE, n. A kind of violin or harp. Obs.

   ROTE, n. [L. rota, a wheel.]

   Properly, a round of words; frequent repetition of words or sounds,
   without attending to the signification, or to principles and rules; a
   practice that impresses words in the memory without an effort of the
   understanding, and without the aid of rules. Thus children learn to
   speak by rote; they often repeat what they hear, till it becomes
   familiar to them. So we learn to sing by rote, as we hear notes
   repeated, and soon learn to repeat them ourselves.

       ROTE, v.t. To fix in the memory by means of frequent repetition
   ourselves, or by hearing the repetition of others, without an effort of
    the understanding to comprehend what is repeated, and without the aid
                   of rules or principles. [Little used.]

       ROTE, v.i. To go out by rotation or succession. [Little used.]

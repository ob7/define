[1]camber

   CAMBER, n. Among builders, camber or camber-beam is a piece of timber
   cut archwise, or with an obtuse angle in the middle, used in platforms,
   where long and strong beams are required. As a verb, this word
   signifies to bend, but I know not that it is used.

   A cambered-deck, is one which is higher in the middle, or arched, but
   drooping or declining towards the stem and stern; also, when it is
   irregular.

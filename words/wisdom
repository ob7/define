   WISDOM, n. s as z. [G. See Wise.]

   1. The right use or exercise of knowledge; the choice of laudable ends,
   and of the best means to accomplish them. This is wisdom in act,
   effect, or practice. If wisdom is to be considered as a faculty of the
   mind, it is the faculty of discerning or judging what is most just,
   proper and useful, and if it is to be considered as an acquirement, it
   is the knowledge and use of what is best, most just, most proper, most
   conducive to prosperity or happiness. Wisdom in the first sense, or
   practical wisdom, is nearly synonymous with discretion. It differs
   somewhat from prudence, in this respect; prudence is the exercise of
   sound judgment in avoiding evils; wisdom is the exercise of sound
   judgment either in avoiding evils or attempting good. Prudence then is
   a species, of which wisdom is the genus.

   Wisdom gained by experience, is of inestimable value.

   It is hoped that our rulers will act with dignity and wisdom; that they
   will yield every thing to reason, and refuse every thing to force.

   2. In Scripture, human learning; erudition; knowledge of arts and
   sciences.

   Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians. Acts 7.

   3. Quickness of intellect; readiness of apprehension; dexterity in
   execution; as the wisdom of Bezaleel and Aholiab. Exodus 31.

   4. Natural instinct and sagacity. Job 39.

   5. In Scripture theology, wisdom is true religion; godliness; piety;
   the knowledge and fear of God, and sincere and uniform obedience to his
   commands. This is the wisdom which is from above. Psalm 90. Job 28.

   6. Profitable words or doctrine. Psalm 37.

   The wisdom of this world, mere human erudition; or the carnal policy of
   men, their craft and artifices in promoting their temporal interests;
   called also fleshly wisdom. 1 Corinthians 2. 2 Corinthians 1.

   The wisdom of words, artificial or affected eloquence; or learning
   displayed in teaching. 1 Corinthians 1 and 2.

[1]morrow

   MOR'ROW, n.

   1. The day next after the present.

   Till this stormy night is gone,

   And th' eternal morrow dawn.

   This word is often preceded by on or to.

   The Lord did that thing on the morrow. Ex.9.

   To morrow shall this sign be. Ex.8.

   So we say, to night, to day. To morrow is equivalent to on the morrow.

   2. The next day subsequent to any day specified.

   But if the sacrifice of his offering shall be a vow or a voluntary
   offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his
   sacrifice; and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten.
   Lev.7.

              Good morrow, a term of salutation; good morning.

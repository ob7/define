   WELSH, a. [G., foreign, strange, Celtic.] Pertaining to the Welsh
   nation.

   WELSH, n.

   1. The language of Wales or of the Welsh.

   2. The general name of the inhabitants of Wales. The word signifies
   foreigners or wanderers, and was given to this people by other nations,
   probably because they came from some distant country. The Welsh call
   themselves Cymry, in the plural, and a Welshman Cymro, and their
   country Cymra, of which the adjective is Cymreig, and the name of their
   language, Cymraeg. They are supposed to be the Cimbri of Jutland.

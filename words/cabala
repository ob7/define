[1]cabala

   CABALA, [See the preceding word. It is from the sense of reception.]
   Tradition, or a mysterious kind of science among Jewish Rabbins,
   pretended to have been delivered to the ancient Jews by revelation, and
   transmitted by oral tradition; serving for the interpretation of
   difficult passages of scripture. This science consists chiefly in
   understanding the combination of certain letters, words and numbers,
   which are alleged to be significant. Every letter, word, number and
   accent of the law is supposed to contain a mystery, and the cabalists
   pretend even to foretell future events by the study of this science.

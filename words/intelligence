[1]intelligence

   INTEL'LIGENCE, n. [L. intelligentia, from intelligo, to understand.
   This verb is probably composed of in, inter, or intus, within, and lego
   to collect. The primary sense of understand is generally to take or
   hold, as we say, to take one's ideas or meaning.]

   1. Understanding; skill.

   2. Notice; information communicated; an account of things distant or
   before unknown. Intelligence may be transmitted by messengers, by
   letters, by signals or by telegraphs.

   3. Commerce of acquaintance; terms of intercourse. Good intelligence
   between men is harmony. So we say, there is a good understanding
   between persons, when they have the same views, or are free from
   discord.

   4. A spiritual being; as a created intelligence. It is believed that
   the universe is peopled with innumerable superior intelligences.

         INTEL'LIGENCE, v.t. To inform; to instruct. [Little used.]

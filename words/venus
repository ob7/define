   VE'NUS, n. [L. ventus, venenum; Eng. venom to poison, to fret or
   irritate. These affinities lead to the true origin of these words. The
   primary sense of the root is to shoot or rush, as light or wind. From
   light is derived the sense of white, fair, Venus, or it is from
   opening, parting; and from rushing, moving, comes wind, and the sense
   of raging, fury, whence L. venenum, poison, that which frets or causes
   to rage. These words all coincide with L. venio, which signifies to
   rush, to fall, to happen; venor, to hunt, &c. The Greeks had the same
   idea of the goddess of love, viz. that her name signified fairness,
   whiteness, and hence the fable that she sprung from froth, whence her
   Green name.]

   1. In mythology, the goddess of beauty and love; that is, beauty or
   love deified; just as the Gaelic and Irish diana, swiftness,
   impetuosity, is denominated the goddess of hunting.

   2. In astronomy, one of the inferior planets, whose orbit is between
   the earth and Mercury; a star of brilliant splendor.

   3. In the old chimistry, a name given to copper.

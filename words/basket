     flexible things interwoven. The forms and sizes of baskets are very
         various, as well as the uses to which they are applied; as
       corn-baskets, clothes-baskets, fruit-baskets, and work-baskets.

   2. The contents of a basket; as much as a basket will contain; as, a
   basket of medlars is two bushels. But in general, this quantity is
   indefinite.

   In military affairs, baskets of earth sometimes are used on the parapet
    of a trench, between which the soldiers fire. They serve for defense
                             against small shot.

                      B'ASKET, v.t. To put in a basket.

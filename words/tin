   TIN, n. [L. stannum; stagnum.]

   1. A white metal, with a slight tinge of yellow. It is soft,
   non-elastic, very malleable, and when a bar of it is bent near the ear,
   distinguished by a crackling sound called the cry of tin. It is used
   for culinary vessels, being for this purpose usually combined with
   lead, forming pewter; and alloyed with small proportions of antimony,
   copper and bismuth, is formed into various wares resembling silver,
   under the names of block-tin, brittania, &c. Equal parts of tin and
   lead compose soder. Tin united with copper in different proportions,
   forms bronze, bell-metal, and speculum-metal.

   2. Thin plates of iron covered with tin.

            TIN, v.t. To cover with tin, or overlay with tinfoil.

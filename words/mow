   MOW, n. A heap, mass or pile of hay deposited in a barn.

   [We never give this name to hay piled in the field or open air. The
   latter is called a stack or rick.]

     MOW, v.t. To lay hay in a heap or mass in a barn, or to lay it in a
                              suitable manner.

   MOW, v.t. pret. mower; pp. mowed or mown. [The L. has meto, and the Gr.
        to mow or reap. The last radical letter is not ascertained.]

   1. To cut down with a scythe, as grass or other plants. We say, to mow
   grass.

   2. To cut the grass from; as, to mow a meadow.

   3. To cut down with speed; to cut down indiscriminately, or in great
   numbers or quantity. We say, a discharge of grape shot mows down whole
   ranks of men. Hence Saturn or Time is represented with a scythe, an
   emblem of the general and indiscriminate destruction of the human race
   by death.

   MOW, v.i. To cut grass; to practice mowing; to use the scythe. Does the
                                man mow well?

   1. To perform the business of mowing; to cut and make grass into hay;
   to gather the crop of grass, or other crop.

   [In America, mow is not applied to the cutting of wheat or rye. When
   these are cut with a scythe, they are said to be cradled. Oats and
   barley are sometimes mowed.]

                      MOW, n. [from mouth.] A wry face.

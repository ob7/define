[1]socage

   SOC'AGE, n. [from soc,supra, a privilege.] In English law, a tenure of
   lands and tenements by a cetain or determinate service; a tenure
   distinct from chivalry or knight's service, in which the render was
   uncertain. The service must be certain, in order to be denominated
   socage; as to hold by fealty and twenty shillings rent. Socage is of
   two kinds; free socage, where the services are not only certain, but
   honorable, and villein socage, where the services, though certain, are
   of a baser nature.

[1]mother

   MOTHER, n. [L. mater, mother; matrix, the womb; materia, matter, stuff,
   materials of which any thing is made. We observe that in some other
   languages, as well as in English, the same word signifies a female
   parent, and the thick slime formed in vinegar; and in all the languages
   of Europe here cited, the orthography is nearly the same as that of mud
   and matter. The question then occurs whether the name of a female
   parent originated in a word expressing matter, mold; either the soil of
   the earth, as the producer, or the like substance, when shaped and
   fitted as a mold for castings; or whether the name is connected with
   the opinion that the earth is the mother of all productions; whence the
   word mother-earth. We are informed by a fragment of Sanchoniathon, that
   the ancient Phenicians considered mud to be the substance from which
   all things were formed. See Mud. The word matter is evidently from the
   Ar. madda, to secrete, eject or discharge a purulent substance; and I
   think cannot have any direct connection with mud. But in the Italian,
   Spanish and Portuguese, the same word madre signified mother, and a
   mold for castings; and the northern languages, particularly the German
   and Danish, seem to establish the fact that the proper sense of mother
   is matrix. Hence mother of pearl, the matrix of pearl. If this word had
   its origin in the name of the earth used for the forms of castings, it
   would not be a singular fact; for our word mold, in this sense, I
   suppose to be so named from mold, fine earth. The question remains sub
   judice.]

   1. A female parent; especially, one of the human race; a woman who has
   borne a child; correlative to son or daughter.

   2. That which has produced any thing.

   Alas, poor country! it cannot

   Be called our mother, but our grave.

   So our native land is called mother country, and a plant from which a
   slip or cion is taken, is called the mother plant. In this use, mother
   may be considered as an adjective.

   as a mother-church.

   has been a mother to me."

   vinegar, very different from scum or common lees.

   CONCEPTION, n. [L., See Conceive.]

   1. The act of conceiving; the first formation of the embryo or fetus of
   an animal.

   I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception. Genesis 3.

   2. The state of being conceived.

   Joy had the like conception in our eyes.

   3. In pneumatology, apprehension of nay thing by the mind; the act of
   conceiving in the mind; that mental act or combination of acts by which
   an idea or notion is formed of an absent object of perception, or of a
   sensation formerly felt. When we see an object with our eyes open, we
   have a perception of it; when the same object is presented to the mind
   with the eyes shut, in idea only or in memory, we have a conception of
   it.

   4. Conception may be sometimes used for the power of conceiving ideas,
   as when we say, a thing is not within our conception. Some writers have
   defined conception as a distinct faculty of the mind; but it is
   considered by others as memory, and perhaps with propriety.

   5. Purpose conceived; conception with reference to the performance of
   an act.

   6. Apprehension; knowledge.

   And as if beasts conceived what reason were, and that conception should
   distinctly show.

   7. Conceit; affected sentiment, or thought.

   He is too full of conceptions, points of epigram, and witticisms.

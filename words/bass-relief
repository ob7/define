   BASS-RELIE'F, n. In English, base-relief. [See Lift and Relief.]

   Sculpture, whose figures do not stand out far from the ground or plane
   on which they are formed. When figures do not protuberate so as to
   exhibit the entire body, they are said to be done in relief; and when
   they are low, flat or little raised from the plane,

   the work is said to be in low relief. When the figures are so raised as
   to be well distinguished, they are said to be bold, strong, or high,
   alto relievo. [See Relief.]

[1]cudgel

   CUDGEL, n. A short thick stick of wood, such as may be used by the hand
   in beating. It differs strictly from a club, which is larger at one end
   than the other. It is shorter than a pole, and thicker than a rod.

   To cross the cudgels, to forbear the contest; a phrase borrowed from
   the practice of cudgel-players, who lay one cudgel over another.

                                CUDGEL, v.t.

   1. To beat with a cudgel, or thick stick.

   2. To beat in general.

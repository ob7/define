   AC'TINOLITE, n. [Gr. a ray, a stone.]

   A mineral, called, by Werner, strahlstein, ray-stone, nearly allied to
   hornblend. It occurs in prismatic crystals, which are long, and
   incomplete, and sometimes extremely minute and even fibrous. Its
   prevailing color is green of different shades, or shaded with yellow or
   brown. There are several varieties, as the common, the massive, the
   acicular, the glassy, and the fibrous.

   Actinolite is crystalized, asbestiform, and glassy.

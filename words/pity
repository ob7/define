[1]pity

   PITY, n. [The Latin,Italian, Spanish and Portuguese languages unite
   pity and piety in the same word, and the word may be from the root of
   compassion; L. patior, to suffer.]

   1. The feeling or suffering of one person, excited by the distresses of
   another; sympathy with the grief or misery of another; compassion or
   fellow-suffering.

   He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth to the Lord. Prov.19.

   In Scripture however, the word pity usually includes

   compassion accompanied with some act of charity or benevolence, and not
                    simply a fellow feeling of distress.

   Pity is always painful, yet always agreeable.

   2. The ground or subject of pity; cause of grief; thing to be
   regretted.

   What pity is it

   That we can die but once to serve our country!

   That he is old, the more is the pity, his white hairs do witness it.

   In this sense, the word has a plural. It is a thousand pities he should
   waste his estate in prodigality.

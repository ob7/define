   RELIGION, n. relij'on. [L. religio, from religo, to bind anew; re and
   ligo, to bind. This word seems originally to have signified an oath or
   vow to the gods, or the obligation of such an oath or vow, which was
   held very sacred by the Romans.]

   1. Religion, in its most comprehensive sense, includes a belief in the
   being and perfections of God, in the revelation of his will to man, in
   man's obligation to obey his commands, in a state of reward and
   punishment, and in man's accountableness to God; and also true
   godliness or piety of life, with the practice of all moral duties. It
   therefore comprehends theology, as a system of doctrines or principles,
   as well as practical piety; for the practice of moral duties without a
   belief in a divine lawgiver, and without reference to his will or
   commands, is not religion.

   2. Religion, as distinct from theology, is godliness or real piety in
   practice, consisting in the performance of all known duties to God and
   our fellow men, in obedience to divine command, or from love to God and
   his law. James 1.

   3. Religion, as distinct from virtue, or morality, consists in the
   performance of the duties we owe directly to God, from a principle of
   obedience to his will. Hence we often speak of religion and virtue, as
   different branches of one system, or the duties of the first and second
   tables of the law.

   Let us with caution indulge the supposition, that morality can be
   maintained without religion.

   4. Any system of faith and worship. In this sense, religion comprehends
   the belief and worship of pagans and Mohammedans, as well as of
   christians; any religion consisting in the belief of a superior power
   or powers governing the world, and in the worship of such power or
   powers. Thus we speak of the religion of the Turks, of the Hindoos, of
   the Indians, &c. as well as of the christian religion. We speak of
   false religion, as well as of true religion.

   5. The rites of religion; in the plural.

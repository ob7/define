   CONSTRUE, v.t. [L. See Construct.]

   1. To arrange words in their natural order; to reduce from a transposed
   to a natural order, so as to discover the sense of a sentence; hence,
   to interpret; and when applied to a foreign language, to translate; to
   render into English; as, to construe Greek, Latin or French.

   2. To interpret; to explain; to show or to understand the meaning.

   I pray that I may not be so understood or construed.

   Thus we are put to construe and paraphrase our own words.

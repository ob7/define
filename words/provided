[1]provided

   PROVI'DED, pp. Procured beforehand; made ready for future use;
   supplied; furnished; stipulated.

   1. Stipulated as a condition, which condition is expressed in the
   following sentence or words; as, "provided that nothing in this act
   shall prejudice the rights of any person whatever." This sentence is in
   the nature of the case absolute, the clause or sentence independent;
   "this or that being provided, which follows;" "this condition being
   provided." The word being is understood, and the participle provided
   agrees with the whole sentence absolute. "This condition being
   previously stipulated or established." This and that here refer to the
   whole member of the sentence.

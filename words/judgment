   JUDG'MENT, n. The act of judging; the act or process of the mind in
   comparing its ideas, to find their agreement or disagreement, and to
   ascertain truth; or the process of examining facts and arguments, to
   ascertain propriety and justice; or the process of examining the
   relations between one proposition and another.

   1. The faculty of the mind by which man is enabled to compare ideas and
   ascertain the relations of terms and propositions; as a man of clear
   judgment or sound judgment. The judgment may be biased by prejudice.
   Judgment supplies the want of certain knowledge.

   2. The determination of the mind, formed from comparing the relations
   of ideas, or the comparison of facts and arguments. In the formation of
   our judgments, we should be careful to weigh and compare all the facts
   connected with the subject.

   3. In law, the sentence of doom pronounced in any cause, civil or
   criminal, by the judge or court by which it is tried. Judgment may be
   rendered on demurrer, on a verdict, on a confession or default, or on a

   properly the determination or sentence of the law. A pardon may be
   pleaded in arrest of judgment.

   4. The right or power of passing sentence.

   5. Determination; decision.

   Let reason govern us in the formation of our judgment of things

   to discern right and wrong, good and evil.

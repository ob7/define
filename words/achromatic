   ACHROMAT'IC, a. [Gr. priv. and color.]

   Destitute of color. achromatic telescopes are formed of a combination
   of lenses, which separate the variously color rays of light to equal
   angles of divergence, at different angles of refraction of the mean
   ray. In this case, the rays being made to refract towards contrary
   parts, the whole ray is caused to deviate from its course, without
   being separated into colors, and the optical aberration arising from
   the various colors of light, is prevented. This telescope is an
   invention of Dolland.

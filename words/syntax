   SYN'TAX, n. [L. syntaxis; Gr. together, and to put.]

   1. In grammar, the construction of sentences; the due arrangement of
   words in sentences, according to established usage. Syntax includes
   concord and regimen, or the agreement and government of words. Words,
   in every language, have certain connections and relations, as verbs and
   adjectives with nouns, which relations must be observed in the
   formation of sentences. A gross violation of the rules of syntax is a
   solecism.

   2. Connected system or order; union of things. [Not in use.]

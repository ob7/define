[1]eon

   E'ON, n. [Gr. age, duration.] In the platonic philosophy, a virtue,
   attribute or perfection. The Platonists represented the deity as an
   assemblage of eons. The Gnostics considered eons as certain substantial
   powers or divine natures emanating from the Supreme Deity, and
   performing various parts in the operations of the universe.

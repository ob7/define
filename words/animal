[1]animal

   AN'IMAL, n. [L. animal, from anima, air, breath, soul.]

   An organized body, endowed with life and the power of voluntary motion;
   a living, sensitive, locomotive body; as, man is an intelligent animal.
   Animals are essentially distinguished from plants by the property of
   sensation. The contractile property of some plants, as the mimosa, has
   the appearance of the effect of sensation, but it may be merely the
   effect of irritability.

   The distinction here made between animals and vegetables, may not be
   philosophically accurate; for we cannot perhaps ascertain the precise
   limit between the two kinds of beings, but this is sufficiently correct
   for common practical purposes.

   The history of animals is called zoology.

   By way of contempt, a dull person is called a stupid animal.

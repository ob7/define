[1]chaff

   CHAFF, n.

   1. The husk, or dry calyx of corn, and grasses. In common language, the
   word is applied to the husks when separated from the corn by thrashing,
   riddling or winnowing. The word is sometimes used rather improperly to
   denote straw cut small for the food of cattle.

   2. Refuse; worthless matter; especially that which is light, and apt to
   be driven by the wind. In scripture, false doctrines, fruitless
   designs, hypocrites and ungodly men are compared to chaff. Ps. 1:4;
   Jer. 23:28; Is. 33:11; Mat. 3:12.

[1]ecstasy

   EC'STASY, n. [Gr. to stand.]

   1. Primarily, a fixed state; a trance; a state in which the mind is
   arrested and fixed, or as we say, lost; a state in which the functions
   of the senses are suspended by the contemplation of some extraordinary
   or supernatural object.

   Whether what we call ecstasy be not dreaming with our eyes open, I
   leave to be examined.

   2. Excessive joy; rapture; a degree of delight that arrests the whole
   mind; as a pleasing ecstasy; the ecstasy of love; joy may rise to
   ecstasy.

   3. Enthusiasm; excessive elevation and absorption of mind; extreme
   delight.

   He on the tender grass

   Would sit and hearken even to ecstasy.

   4. Excessive grief or anxiety. [Not used.]

   5. Madness; distraction. [Not used.]

   6. In medicine, a species of catalepsy, when the person remembers,
   after the paroxysm is over, the ideas he had during the fit.

             EC'STASY, v.t. To fill with rapture or enthusiasm.

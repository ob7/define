   RI'OT, n.

   1. In a general sense, tumult; uproar; hence technically, in law, a
   riotous assembling of twelve persons or more, and not dispersing upon
   proclamation.

   The definition of riot must depend on the laws. In Connecticut, the
   assembling of three persons or more, to do an unlawful act by violence
   against the person or property of another, and not dispersing upon
   proclamation, is declared to be a riot. In Massachusetts and New
   Hampshire, the number necessary to constitute a riot is twelve.

   2. Uproar; wild and noisy festivity.

   3. Excessive and expensive feasting. 2Peter 2.

   4. Luxury.

   The lamb thy riot dooms to bleed today.

   To run riot, to act or move without control or restraint.

                                 RI'OT, v.i.

   1. To revel; to run to excess in feasting, drinking or other sensual
   indulgences.

   2. To luxuriate; to be highly excited.

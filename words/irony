              I'RONY, [L. ironia; Gr. a dissembler in speech.]

   A mode of speech expressing a sense contrary to that which the speaker
   intends to convey; as, Nero was a very virtuous prince; Pope Hildebrand
   was remarkable for his meekness and humility. when irony is uttered,the
   dissimulation is generally apparent from the manner of speaking, as by
        a smile or an arch look, or perhaps by an affected gravity of
     countenance. Irony in writing may also be detected by the manner of
                                 expression.

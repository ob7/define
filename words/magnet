[1]magnet

   MAG'NET, n. [L. from Gr. Magnesia, in Asia Minor.] The lodestone; an
   ore of iron which has the peculiar properties of attracting metallic
   iron, of pointing to the poles, and of dipping or inclining downwards.
   These properties it communicates to iron by contact. A bar of iron to
   which these properties are imparted, is called an artificial magnet.

[1]or

   OR, a termination of Latin nouns, is a contraction of vir, a man, or
   from the same radix. The same word vir, is in our mother tongue, wer,
   and from this we have the English termination er.

   It denotes an agent, as in actor, creditor. We annex it to many words
   of English origin, as in lessor, as we do er to words of Latin and
   Greek origin, as in astronomer, laborer. In general, or is annexed to
   words of Latin, and er to those of English origin.

        OR, conj. [It seems that or is a mere contraction of other.]

   A connective that marks an alternative. "You may read or may write;"
   that is, you may do one of the things at your pleasure, but not both.
   It corresponds to either. You may either ride to London, or to Windsor.
   It often connects a series of words or propositions, presenting a
   choice of either. He may study law or medicine or divinity, or he may
   enter into trade.

   Or sometimes begins a sentence, but in this case it expresses an
   alternative with the foregoing sentence. Matt. 7 and 9.

   In poetry, or is sometimes used for either.

   For thy vast bounties are so numberless, that them or to conceal or
   else to tell is equally impossible.

   Or is often used to express an alternative of terms, definitions or
   explanations of the same thing in different words. Thus we say, a thing
   is a square, or a figure under four equal sides and angles.

   Or ever. In this phrase, or is supposed to be a corruption of ere.

                     OR, in heraldry, gold. [L. aurum.]

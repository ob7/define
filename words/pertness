   PERT'NESS, n. Briskness; smartness.

   1. Sauciness; forward promptness or boldness; implying less than
   effrontery or impudence.

   Pertness and ignorance may ask a question in three lines, which it will
   cost learning and ingenuity thirty pages to answer.

   2. Petty liveliness; sprightliness without force,dignity or solidity.

   There is in Shaftsbury's works a lively pertness and a parade of
   literature.

   BREW, v.t.

   1. In a general sense, to boil, and mix; hence in Saxon, it signifies
   broth or pottage; Old. Eng. brewis.

   2. In a more restricted sense, to make beer, ale or other similar
   liquor from malt; or to prepare a liquor from malt and hops, and in
   private families, from other materials, by steeping, boiling and
   fermentation.

   3. To mingle.

   Brew me a pottle of sack.

   4. To contrive; to plot; as, to brew mischief.

   5. To put in a state of preparation.

    BREW, v.i. To be in a state of preparation; to be mixing, forming or
      collecting; as, a storm brews in the west. In this sense I do not
   recollect the use of the verb, in a transitive sense, and generally the
              participle only is used; as, a storm is brewing.

   1. To perform the business of brewing or making beer; as, she can brew,
   wash and bake.

        BREW, n. The mixture formed by brewing; that which is brewed.

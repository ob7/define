   SIEGE, n. [L. sigillum.]

   1. The setting of an army around or before a fortified place for the
   purpose of compelling the garrison to surrender; or the surrounding or
   investing of a place by an army, and approaching it by passages and
   advanced works, which cover the besiegers from the enemy's fire. A
   siege differs from a blockade, as in a siege the investing army
   approaches the fortified place to attach and reduce it by force; but in
   a blockade, the army secures all the avenues to the place to intercept
   all supplies, and waits till famine compels the garrison to surrender.

   2. Any continued endeavor to gain possession. Love stood the siege, and
   would not yield his breast.

   3. Seat; throne.

   4. Rank; place; class.

   5. Stool. [Not in use.]

                   SIEGE, v. t. To besiege. [Not in use.]

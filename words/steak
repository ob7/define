[1]steak

   STEAK, n. [G., a piece.] A slice of beef or pork broiled, or cut for
   broiling. [As far as my observation extends, this word is never applied
   to any species of meat, except to beef and pork, nor to these dressed
   in any way except by broiling. Possible it may be used of a piece
   fried.]

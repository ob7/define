[1]elasticity

   ELASTIC'ITY, n. The inherent property in bodies by which they recover
   their former figure or state, after external pressure,tension or
   distortion. Thus elastic gum, extended, will contract to its natural
   dimensions, when the force is removed. Air, when compressed, will, on
   the removal of the compressing force, instantly dilate and fill its
   former space.

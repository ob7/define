[1]sepulcher

   SEP'ULCHER, n. [from L. sepulchrum, from sepelio, to bury, which seems
   to be formed with a prefix on the Goth. filhan, to bury.] A grave;
   atomb; the place in which a dead body of a human being is interred, or
   a place destined for that purpose. Among the Jews sepulchers were often
   excavations in rocks.

   SEP'ULCHER, v. t. To bury; to inter; to entomb; as obscurely
   sepulchered.

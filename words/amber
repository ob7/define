   AM'BER, n. [In 1Kings 10:2-10, the Arabic is rendered spices. The
   Arabic word is rendered by Castle, amber, a marine fish, a shield made
   of skins, crocus and fimus.]

   A hard semi-pellucid substance, tasteless and without smell, except
   when pounded or heated, when it emits a fragrant odor. It is found in
   alluvial soils, or on the sea shore, in many places; particularly on
   the shores of the Baltic, in Europe, and at Cape Sable, in Maryland, in
   the United States. The ancient opinion of its vegetable origin seems
   now to be established, and it is believed or known to be a fossil
   resin. It yields by distillation an empyreumatic oil, and succinic
   acid, which sublimes in small white needles. Its color usually presents
   some tinge of yellow. it is highly electrical, and is the basis of a
   varnish.

               AM'BER, a. Consisting of, or resembling amber.

                      AM'BER, v.t. To scent with amber.

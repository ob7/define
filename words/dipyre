   DIPYRE, n. A mineral occurring in minute prisms, either single or
   adhering to each other in fascicular groups. Before the blowpipe, it
   melts with ebullition or intumescence, and its powder on hot coals
   phosphoresces with a feeble light. Its name, from Gr., two; fire,
   indicates the double effect of fire, in producing fusion and
   phosphorescence.

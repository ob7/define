[1]nonsuit

   NON'SUIT, n. In law, the default, neglect or non-appearance of the
   plaintiff in a suit, when called in court, by which the plaintiff
   signifies his intention to drop the suit. Hence a nonsuit amounts to a
   stoppage of the suit. A nonsuit differs from a retraxit; a nonsuit is
   the default or neglect of the plaintiff, and after this he may bring
   another suit for the same cause; but a retraxit is an open positive
   renunciation of the suit, by which he forever loses his action. [See
   the Verb.]

   NON'SUIT, v.t. To determine or record that the plaintiff drops his
   suit, on default of appearance when called in court. When a plaintiff
   being called in court, declines to answer, or when he neglects to
   deliver his declaration, he is supposed to drop his suit; he is
   therefore nonsuited, that is, his non-appearance is entered on the
   record, and this entry amounts to a judgment of the court that the
   plaintiff has dropped the suit.

   When two are joined in a writ, and one is nonsuited--

                           NON'SUIT, a. Nonsuited.

   The plaintiff must become nonsuit.

[1]sailor

   SA'ILOR, n. [a more common spelling than sailer.]

   A mariner; a seaman; one who follows the business of navigating ships
   or other vessels, or one who understands the management of ships in
   navigation. The word however does not by itself express any particular
   skill in navigation. It denotes any person who follows the seas, and is
   chiefly or wholly applied to the common hands. [See Seaman.]

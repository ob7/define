   DOCTRINE, n. [L., to teach.]

   1. In a general sense, whatever is taught. Hence, a principle or
   position in any science; whatever is laid down as true by an instructor
   or master. The doctrines of the gospel are the principles or truths
   taught by Christ and his apostles. The doctrines of Plato are the
   principles which he taught. Hence a doctrine may be true or false; it
   may be a mere tenet or opinion.

   2. The act of teaching.

   He taught them many things by parables, and said to them in his
   doctrine. Mark 4.

   3. Learning; knowledge.

   Whom shall he make to understand doctrine? Isaiah 28.

   4. The truths of the gospel in general.

   That they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things. Titus
   2.

   5. Instruction and confirmation in the truths of the gospel. 2 Timothy
   3.

[1]faith

   FAITH, n. [L. fides, fido, to trust; Gr. to persuade, to draw towards
   any thing, to conciliate; to believe, to obey. In the Greek Lexicon of
   Hederic it is said, the primitive signification of the verb is to bind
   and draw or lead, as signifies a rope or cable. But this remark is a
   little incorrect. The sense of the verb, from which that of rope and
   binding is derived, is to strain, to draw, and thus to bind or make
   fast. A rope or cable is that which makes fast. Heb.]

   1. Belief; the assent of the mind to the truth of what is declared by
   another, resting on his authority and veracity, without other evidence;

   3. In theology, the assent of the mind or understanding to the truth of
   what God has revealed. Simple belief of the scriptures, of the being
   and perfections of God, and of the existence, character and doctrines
   of Christ, founded on the testimony of the sacred writers, is called
   historical or speculative faith; a faith little distinguished from the
   belief of the existence and achievements of Alexander or of Cesar.

   4. Evangelical, justifying, or saving faith, is the assent of the mind
   to the truth of divine revelation, on the authority of God's testimony,
   accompanied with a cordial assent of the will or approbation of the
   heart; an entire confidence or trust in God's character and
   declarations, and in the character and doctrines of Christ, with an
   unreserved surrender of the will to his guidance, and dependence on his
   merits for salvation. In other words, that firm belief of God's
   testimony, and of the truth of the gospel, which influences the will,
   and leads to an entire reliance on Christ for salvation.

   TAX, n. [L. taxo, to tax.]

   1. A rate or sum of money assessed on the person or property of a
   citizen by government, for the use of the nation or state. Taxes, in
   free governments, are usually laid upon the property of citizens
   according to their income, or the value of their estates. Tax is a term
   of general import, including almost every species of imposition on
   persons or property for supplying the public treasury, as tolls,
   tribute, subsidy, excise, impost, or customs. But more generally, tax
   is limited to the sum laid upon polls, lands, houses, horses, cattle,
   professions and occupations. So we speak of a land tax, a window tax, a
   tax on carriages, &c. Taxes are annual or perpetual.

   2. A sum imposed on the persons and property of citizens to defray the
   expenses of a corporation, society, parish or company; as a city tax, a
   county tax, a parish tax, and the like. So a private association may
   lay a tax on its members for the use of the association.

   3. That which is imposed; a burden. The attention that he gives to
   public business is a heavy tax on his time.

   4. Charge; censure.

   5. Task.

[1]pulsation

   PULSA'TION, n. [L. pulsatio,supra.] The beating or throbbing of the
   heart or of an artery, in the process of carrying on the circulation of
   the blood. The blood being propelled by the contraction of the heart,
   causes the arteries to dilate, so as to render each dilation
   perceptible to the touch in certain parts of the body, as in the radial
   artery, &c.

   1. In law, any touching of another's body willfully or in anger. This
   constitutes battery.

   By the Cornelian law, pulsation as well as verberation is prohibited.

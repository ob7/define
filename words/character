   used to form words, and communicate ideas. Characters are literal, as
   the letters of an alphabet; numeral, as the arithmetical figures;

   4. The peculiar qualities, impressed by nature or habit on a person,
   which distinguish him from others; these constitute real character, and

   qualities that, in public estimation, belong to a person in a
   particular station; as when we ask how a magistrate, or commander
   supports his character.

   9. In natural history, the peculiar discriminating qualities or
   properties of animals, plants and minerals.

   These properties, when employed for the purpose of discriminating
   minerals, are called characters.

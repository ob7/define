   METALEP'SIS, n. [Gr. participation; beyond, and to take.]

   In rhetoric, the continuation of a trope in one word through a
   succession of significations, or the union of two or more tropes of a
   different kind in one word, so that several gradations or intervening
   senses come between the word expressed and the thing intended by it; as
   "in one Caesar there are many Mariuses." Here Marius, by a synecdoche
   or antonomasy, is put for any ambitious, turbulent man, and this, by a
   metonymy of the cause, for the ill effects of such a temper to the
   public.

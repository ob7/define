   CHIMISTRY, n. Chimistry is a science, the object of which is to
   discover the nature and properties of all bodies by analysis and
   synthesis.

   Chimistry is that science which explains the intimate mutual action of
   all natural bodies.

   Analysis or decomposition, and synthesis or combination, are the two
   methods which chimistry uses to accomplish its purposes.

   Chimistry may be defined, the science which investigates the
   composition of material substances, and the permanent changes of
   constitution which their mutual actions produce.

   Chimistry may be defined, that science, the object of which is to
   discover and explain the changes of composition that occur among the
   integrant and constituent parts of different bodies.

   Chimistry is the science which treats of those events and changes in
   natural bodies, which are not accompanied by sensible motions.

   Chimistry is justly considered as a science, but the practical
   operations may be denominated an art.

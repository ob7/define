[1]intrenchment

   INTRENCH'MENT, n. Properly, a trench or ditch only; but as the earth
   thrown out of a trench forms a part,and often the most necessary and
   useful part of a fortification, hence intrenchment is generally
   understood to signify a ditch and parapet,and sometimes it signifies
   fascines covered with earth, gabions, bags filled with earth, or other
   materials collected to cover men from an enemy's fire.

   On our side we have thrown up intrenchments on Winter and Prospect
   hills.

   RECOMMEND', v.t. [re and commend.]

   1. To praise to another; to offer or commend to another's notice,
   confidence or kindness by favorable representations.

   Maecenas recommended Virgil and Horace to Augustus.

   [In this sense, commend, though less common, is the preferable word.]

   2. To make acceptable.

   A decent boldness ever meets with friends, succeeds, and ev'n a
   stranger recommends.

   3. To commit with prayers.

   Paul chose Silas and departed, being recommended by the brethren to the
   grace of God. Acts. 15.

   [Commend here is much to be preferred.]

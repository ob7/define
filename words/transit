   TRANS'IT, n. [L. transitus, from transeo.]

   1. A passing; a passing over or through; conveyance; as the transit of
   goods through a country.

   2. In astronomy, the passing of one heavenly body over the disk of
   another and larger. I witnessed the transit of Venus over the sun's
   disk, June 3, 1769. When a smaller body passes behind a larger, it is
   said to suffer an occultation.

   3. The passage of one heavenly body over the meridian of another.

          TRANS'IT, v.t. To pass over the disk of a heavenly body.

[1]boldness

   BOLDNESS, n. Courage; bravery; intrepidity; spirit; fearlessness. I
   cannot, with Johnson, interpret this word by fortitude or magnanimity.
   Boldness does not, I think, imply the firmness of mind, which
   constitutes fortitude,nor the elevation and generosity of magnanimity.

   1. Prominence; the quality of exceeding the ordinary rules of
   scrupulous nicety and caution; applied to style, expression, and
   metaphors in language; and to figures in painting, sculpture and
   architecture.

   2. Freedom from timidity; liberty.

   Great is my boldness of speech towards you. 2 Cor.7.

   3. Confidence; confident trust.

   We have boldness and access with confidence. Eph.3.

   4. Freedom from bashfulness; assurance; confident mien.

   5. Prominence; steepness; as the boldness of the shore.

   6. Excess of freedom, bordering on impudence.

   ASH, n.

   1. A well known tree, of which there are many species. There is no
   hermaphrodite calyx, or it is quadripartite; and no corol, or it is
   tetrapetalous. There are two stamens; one pistil; one seed, contained
   in a membranous, lanceolate capsule, and the pistil of the female
   flower is lanceolate. The leaves are pinnate, and the capsules grow in
   cluster. This wood is valuable, for fuel, as well as for timber; and
   the tree, when it grows in an open field, often forms, with its
   branches, a beautiful oval figure and a thick shade.

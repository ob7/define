[1]trivial

   TRIV'IAL, a. [L. trivialis; probably from Gr.; L. tero, trivi, to wear,
   or from trivium, a highway.]

   1. Trifling; of little worth or importance; inconsiderable; as a
   trivial subject; a trivial affair.

   2. Worthless; vulgar.

     Trivial name, in natural history, the common name for the species,
   which added to the generic name forms the complete denomination of the
    species; the specific name. Thus in Lathyrus aphaca, Lathyrus is the
     generic name, and aphaca the trivial or specific name, and the two
   combined form the complete denomination of the species. Linne at first
      applied the term specific name to the essential character of the
    species, now called the specific definition or difference; but it is
                   now applied solely to the trivial name.

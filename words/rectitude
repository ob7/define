[1]rectitude

   REC'TITUDE, n. [L. rectus, right, straight.]

   In morality, rightness of principle or practice; uprightness of mind;
   exact conformity to truth, or to the rules prescribed for moral
   conduct, either by divine or human laws. Rectitude of mind is the
   disposition to act in conformity to any known standard of right, truth
   or justice; rectitude of conduct is the actual conformity to such
   standard. Perfect rectitude belongs only to the Supreme Being. The more
   nearly the rectitude of men approaches to the standard of the divine
   law, the more exalted and dignified is their character. Want of
   rectitude is not only sinful, but debasing.

   There is a sublimity in conscious rectitude - in comparison with which
   the treasures of earth are not worth naming.

[1]self

   SELF, a. or pron. plu. selves; used chiefly in composition.

   1. In old authors, this sometimes signifies particular, very, or same.
   "And on tham sylfan geare;" in that same year, that very year. Sax.
   Chron. A.D. 1052, 1061.

   Shoot another arrow that self way. Shak.

   On these self hills. Raleigh.

   At that self moment enters Palamon. Dryden.

   In this sense, self is an adjective, and is now obsolete, except when
   followed by same; as on the self-same day; the self-same hour; the
   self-same thing; which is tautology.

   2. In present usage, selfis united to certain personal pronouns and
   pronominal adjectives, to express emphasis or distinction; also when
   the pronoun is used reciprocally. thus, for emphasis, I myself will
   write; I will examine for myself; Thou thyself shalt go; thou shalt see
   for thyself; You yourself shall write; you shall see for yourself. He
   himself shall write; he shall examine for himself. She herself shall
   write; she shall examine for herself. The child itself shall be
   carried; it shall be present itself.

   Reciprocally, I abhor myself; thou enrichest thyself; he loves himself;
   she admires herself; it pleases itself; we value ourselves; ye hurry
   yourselves; they see themselves. I did not hurt him, he hurt himself;
   he did not hurt me, I hurt myself.

   Except when added to pronouns used reciprocally, self serves to give
   emphasis to the pronoun, or to render the distinction expressed by it
   more emphatical. "I myself will decide," not only expresses my
   determination to decide, but the determination that no other shall
   decide.

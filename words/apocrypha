[1]apocrypha

   APOC'RYPHA, n. [Gr. from, to conceal.]

   Literally such things as are not published; but in an appropriate
   sense, books whose authors are not known; whose authenticity, as
   inspired writings, is not admitted, and which are therefore not
   considered a part of the sacred canon of the scripture. When the Jews
   published their sacred books, they called them canonical and divine;
   such as they did not publish, were called apocryphal. The apocryphal
   books are received by the Romish Church as canonical, but not by
   Protestants.

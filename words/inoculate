   INOC'ULATE, v.t. [L. inoculo; in and occulus, the eye.]

   1. To bud; to insert the bud of a tree or plant in another tree or
   plant, for the purpose of growth on the new stock. All sorts of stone
   fruit, apples,pears, &c. may be inoculated. We inoculate the stock with
   a foreign bud.

   2. To communicate a disease to a person by inserting infectious matter
   in his skin or flesh; as, to inoculate a person with the matter of
   small pox or cow pox. When the latter disease is communicated, it is
   called vaccination.

   INOC'ULATE, v.i. To propagate by budding; to practice inoculation. The
   time to inoculate is when the buds are formed at the extremities of the
   same year's shoot, indicating that the spring growth for that season is
                                  complete.

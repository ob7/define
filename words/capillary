   CAPILLARY, a.

   1. Resembling a hair, fine, minute, small in diameter, though long; as
   a capillary tube or pipe; a capillary vessel in animal bodies, such as
   the ramifications of the blood vessels.

   2. In botany, capillary plants are hair-shaped, as the ferns; a term
   used by Ray, Boerhaave and Morison. This class of plants corresponds to
   the order of Filices, in the Sexual method, which bear their flower and
   fruit on the back of the leaf or stalk.

   This term is applied also to leaves which are longer than the setaceous
   or bristle-shaped leaf, to glands resembling hairs, to the filaments,
   to the style, and to the pappus or down affixed to some seeds.

                    CAPILLARY, n. A fine vessel or canal.

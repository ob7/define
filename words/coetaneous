[1]coetaneous

   COETANEOUS, a. Of the same age with another; beginning to exist at the
   same time; with to. Every fault has penal effects, coetaneous to the
   act. But with may be preferable to to. This word is sometimes used as
   synonymous with cotemporary; but coetaneous seems properly to denote
   cotemporary in origin, rather than cotemporary in existence at any
   other period. It may however be used in both senses.

[1]school

   SCHOOL, n. [L. schola; Gr. leisure, vacation from business, lucubration
   at leisure, a place where leisure is enjoyed, a school. The adverb
   signifies at ease, leisurely, slowly, hardly, with labor or difficulty.
   I think, must have been derived from the Latin. This word seems
   originally to have denoted leisure, freedom from business, a time given
   to sports, games or exercises, and afterwards time given to literary
   studies. the sense of a crowd, collection or shoal, seems to be
   derivative.]

   1. A place or house in which persons are instructed in arts, science,
   languages or any species of learning; or the pupils assembled for
   instruction. In American usage, school more generally denotes the
   collective body of pupils in any place of instruction, and under the
   direction and discipline of one or more teachers. Thus we say, a school
   consists of fifty pupils. The preceptor has a large school, or a small
   school. His discipline keeps the school well regulated and quiet.

   2. The instruction or exercises of a collection of pupils or students,
   or the collective body of pupils while engaged in their studies. Thus
   we say, the school begins or opens at eight o'clock, that is, the
   pupils at that hour begin their studies. so we say, the teacher is now
   in school, the school hours are from nine to twelve, and from two to
   five.

   3. The state of instruction.

   Set him betimes to school.

   4. A place of education, or collection of pupils, of any kind; as the
   schools of the prophets. In modern usage, the word school comprehends
   every place of education, as university, college, academy, common or
   primary schools, dancing schools, riding schools, &c.; but ordinarily
   the word is applied to seminaries inferior to universities and
   colleges.

   What is the great community of christians, but one of the innumerable
   schools in the vast plan, which God has instituted for the education of
   various intelligences?

   5. Separate denomination or sect; or a system of doctrine taught by
   particular teachers, or peculiar to any denomination of christians or
   philosophers.

   Let no man be less confident in his faith - by reason of any difference
   in the several schools of christians -

   Thus we say, the Socratic school, the Platonic school, the Peripatetic
   or Ionic school; by which we understand all those who adopted and
   adhered to a particular system of opinions.

   6. The seminaries for teaching logic, metaphysics and theology, which
   were formed in the middle ages, and which were characterized by
   academical disputations and subtilties of reasoning; or the learned men
   who were engaged in discussing nice points in metaphysics or theology.

   The supreme authority of Aristotle in the schools of theology as well
   as of philosophy -

   Hence, school divinity is the divinity which discusses nice points, and
   proves every thing by argument.

   7. Any place of improvement or learning. The world is an excellent
   school to wise men, but a school of vice to fools.

[1]emery

   EM'ERY, n. [Gr. and L. smiris.] A mineral, said to be a compact variety
   of corundum, being equal to it in hardness. It is always amorphous; its
   structure finely granular;its color varying from a deep gray to a
   bluish or blackish gray, sometimes brownish. This is almost
   indispensable in polishing metals and hard stones. The lapidaries cut
   ordinary gems on their wheels, by sprinkling them with the moistened
   powder of emery; but it will not cut the diamond.

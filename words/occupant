   OC'CUPANT, n.

   1. He that occupies or takes possession; he that has possession.

   2. In law, one that first takes possession of that which has no legal
   owner. The right of property, either in wild beasts and fowls, or in
   land belonging to no person, vests in the first occupant. The property
   in these cases follows the possession.

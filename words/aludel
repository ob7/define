[1]aludel

   AL'UDEL, n. [a and lutum, without lute. Lunier.]

   In chimistry, aludels are earthern pots without bottoms, that they may
   be exactly fitted into each other, and used in sublimations. At the
   bottom of the furnace is a pot containing the matter to be sublimed,
   and at the top a head to receive the volatile matter.

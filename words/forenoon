   FO'RENOON, n. The former part of the day, from the morning to meridian
   or noon. We usually call the first part of the day, from the dawn to
   the time of breakfast, or the hour of business, the morning, and from
   this period to noon, the forenoon. But the limits are not precisely
   defined by custom.

[1]conditional

   CONDITIONAL, a.

   1. Containing or depending on a condition or conditions; made with
   limitations; not absolute; made or granted on certain terms. A
   conditional promise is one which is to be performed, when something
   else stipulated is done or has taken place. A conditional fee, in law,
   is one which is granted upon condition, that if the donee shall die
   without such particular heirs as are specified, the estate shall revert
   to the donor. Hence it is a fee restrained to particular heirs, to the
   exclusion of others.

   2. In grammar and logic, expressing a condition or supposition; as a
   conditional word, mode, or tense; a conditional syllogism.

                        CONDITIONAL, n. A limitation.

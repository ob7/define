   BRIM'STONE, n. Sulphur; a hard, brittle, inflammable substance, of a
   lemon yellow color, which has no smell, unless heated, and which
   becomes negatively electric by heat and friction. It is found, in great
   quantities, and sometimes pure, in the neighborhood of volcanoes. It is
   an ingredient in a variety of minerals and ores. The sulphur of
   commerce is procured from its natural beds, or artificially extracted
   from pyrites.

[1]hers

   HERS, pron. hurz, pron. fem. possessive; as, this house is hers,that
   is, this is the house of her. But perhaps it would be more correct to
   consider hers as a substitute for the noun and adjective, in the
   nominative case. Of the two houses,hers is the best, that is, her house
   is the best.

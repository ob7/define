   to drive or force asunder, hence to sift, to discern, to judge, to
   separate or cut off danger.]

   1. Any thing that separates or cuts off inconvenience, injury or
   danger,; and hence, that which shelters or protects from danger, or
   prevents inconvenience. Thus a screen is used to intercept the sight,
   to intercept the heat of fire on the light of a candle.

   Some ambitious men seem as screens to princes in matters of danger and
   envy.

   2. A riddle or sieve.

   shelter; to protect; to protect by hiding; to conceal; as fruits
   screened from cold winds by a forest or hill. Our houses and garments
   screen us from cold; an umbrella screens us from rain and the sun's
   rays. Neither rank nor money should screen from punishment the man who
   violates the laws.

   fine, or the worthless from the valuable.

   F'ARTHER, a. comp.

   1. More remote; more distant than something else.

   Let me add a farther truth.

   2. Longer; tending to a greater distance.

   Before our farther way the fates allow.

                               F'ARTHER, adv.

   1. At or to a greater distance; more remotely; beyond. Let us rest with
   what we have, without looking farther.

   2. Moreover; by way of progression in a subject. Farther, let us
   consider the probable event.

   F'ARTHER, v.t. To promote; to advance; to help forward. [little used.]

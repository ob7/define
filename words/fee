[1]fee

   FEE, n. [L. pecu, pecus. From the use of cattle in transferring
   property, or from barter and payments in cattle, the word came to
   signify money; it signified also goods, substance in general. The word
   belongs to Class Bg, but the primary sense is not obvious.]

   A reward or compensation for services; recompense, either gratuitous,
   or established by law and claimed of right. It is applied particularly
   to the reward of professional services; as the fees of lawyers and
   physicians; the fees of office; clerk's fees; sheriff's fees; marriage
   fees, &c. Many of these are fixed by law; but gratuities to
   professional men are also called fees.

    FEE, n. [In English, is loan. This word, fee, inland, or an estate in
    trust, originated among the descendants of the northern conquerors of
         Italy, but it originated in the south of Europe. See Feud.]

   Primarily, a loan of land, an estate in trust, granted by a prince or
   lord, to be held by the grantee on condition of personal service, or
   other condition; and if the grantee or tenant failed to perform the
   conditions, the land reverted to the lord or donor, called the
   landlord, or lend-lord, the lord of the loan. A fee then is any land or
   tenement held of a superior on certain conditions. It is synonymous
   with fief and feud. All the land in England, except the crown land, is
   of this kind. Fees are absolute or limited. An absolute fee or
   fee-simple is land which a man holds to himself and his heirs forever,
   who are called tenants in fee simple. Hence in modern times, the term
   fee or fee simple denotes an estate of inheritance; and in America,
   where lands are not generally held of a superior, a fee or fee simple
   is an estate in which the owner has the whole property without any
   condition annexed to the tenure. A limited fee is an estate limited or
   clogged with certain conditions; as a qualified or base fee, which
   ceases with the existence of certain conditions; and a conditional fee,
   which is limited to particular heirs.

   In the United States, an estate in fee or fee simple is what is called
   in English law an allodial estate, an estate held by a person in his
   own right, and descendible to the heirs in general.

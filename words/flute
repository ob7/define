   same number of holes.]

   by blowing with the mouth, and by stopping and opening the holes with

   cut along the shaft of a column or pilaster; so called from its
   resemblance to a flute. It is used chiefly in the Ionic order;
   sometimes in the Composite and Corinthian; rarely in the Doric and
   Tuscan. It is called also a reed.

   3. A long vessel or boat, with flat ribs or floor timbers, round
   behind, and swelled in the middle; a different orthography of float,
   flota.

   of those of the upper tier removed, used as a transport, is said to be
   armed in flute.

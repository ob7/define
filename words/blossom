[1]blossom

   BLOS'SOM, n. [Gr. a bud, probably from the same root.]

   1. The flower or corol of a plant; a general term, applicable to every
   species of tree or plant, but more generally used than flower or bloom,
   when we have reference to the fruit which is to succeed. Thus we use
   flowers,when we speak of shrubs cultivated for ornament; and bloom, in
   a more general sense, as flowers in general, or in reference to the
   beauty of flowers.

   2. This word is used to denote the color of a horse, that has his hair
   white,but intermixed with sorrel and bay hairs; otherwise,
   peach-colored.

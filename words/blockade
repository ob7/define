   BLOCKA'DE, n. The siege of a place,formed by surrounding it with
   hostile troops or ships, or by posting them at all the avenues, to
   prevent escape,and hinder supplies of provisions and ammunition from
   entering, with a view to compel a surrender,by hunger and want, without
   regular attacks.

   To constitute a blockade, the investing power must be able to apply its
   force to every point of practicable access,so as to render it dangerous
   to attempt to enter; and there is no blockade of that port,where its
   force cannot be brought to bear.

   BLOCKA'DE, v.t. To shut up a town or fortress, by posting troops at all
   the avenues, to compel the garrison or inhabitants to surrender by
   means of hunger and want, without regular attacks; also,to station
   ships of war to obstruct all intercourse with a town or nation.

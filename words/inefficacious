[1]inefficacious

   INEFFICA'CIOUS, a. [L. inefficax; in and efficax, efficio, to effect;
   ex and facio, to make.]

   Not efficacious; not having power to produce the effect desired, or the
   proper effect; of inadequate power or force.

   Ineffectual, says Johnson, rather denotes an actual failure, and
   inefficacious, an habitual impotence to any effect. But the distinction
   is not always observed, nor can it be; for we cannot always know
   whether means are inefficacious, till experiment has proved them
   ineffectual; nor even then, for we cannot be certain that the failure
   of means to produce an effect is to be attributed to habitual want of
   power, or to accidental and temporary causes.

   Inefficacious is therefore sometimes synonymous with ineffectual.

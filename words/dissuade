   DISSUADE, v.t. [L., to advise or incite to any thing.]

   1. To advise or exhort against; to attempt to draw or divert from a
   measure, by reason or offering motives to; as, the minister dissuaded
   the prince from adopting the measure; he dissuaded him from his
   purpose.

   2. To represent as unfit, improper or dangerous.

   War therefore, open or concealed, alike my voice dissuades.

   This phraseology is probably elliptical, and merely poetical; from
   being understood.

   PET'ULANCE'ULANCY, n. [L. petulantia.] Freakish passion; peevishness;
   pettishness; sauciness. Peevishness is not precisely synonymous with
   petulance; the former implying more permanence of a sour, fretful
   temper; the latter more temporary or capricious irritation.

   That which looked like pride in some, and petulance in others.

   The pride and petulance of youth.

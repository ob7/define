[1]purpose

   PUR'POSE, n. [L. propositum, propono; pro, before,and pono, to set or
   place.]

   1. That which a person sets before himself as an object to be reached
   or accomplished; the end or aim to which the view is directed in any
   plan, measure or exertion. We believe the Supreme Being created
   intelligent beings for some benevolent and glorious purpose, and if so,
   how glorious and benevolent must be his purpose in the plan of
   redemption! The ambition of men is generally directed to one of two
   purposes, or to both; the acquisition of wealth or of power. We build
   houses for the purpose of shelter; we labor for the purpose of
   subsistence.

   2. Intention; design. This sense, however, is hardly to be
   distinguished from the former; as purpose always includes the end in
   view.

   Every purpose is established by counsel. Prov.20.

   Being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all
   things after the counsel of his own will. Eph.1.

   3. End; effect; consequence, good or bad. What good purpose will this
   answer? We sometimes labor to no purpose. Men often employ their time,
   talents and money for very evil purposes.

   To what purpose is this waste? Matt.26.

   4. Instance; example. [Not in use.]

   5. Conversation. [Not in use.]

   Of purpose, on purpose, with previous design; with the mind directed to
   that object. On purpose is more generally used, but the true phrase is
                                 of purpose.

    PUR'POSE,v.t. To intend; to design; to resolve; to determine on some
                      end or object to be accomplished.

   I have purposed it,I will also do it. Is.46. Eph.3.

   Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and
   Achaia, to go to Jerusalem. Acts. 19.

   ANIMADVER'SION, n. [L. animadversio.]

   Remarks by way of censure or criticism; reproof; blame. It may
   sometimes be used for punishment, or punishment may be implied in the
   word, but this is not common. In an ecclesiastical sense, it differs
   from censure, says Ayliffe; censure, respecting spiritual punishment,
   and animadversion, a temporal one. Glanville uses the word in the sense
   of perception, but this use is not authorized.

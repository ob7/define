[1]predecessor

   PREDECES'SOR, n. [L. proe and decedo, to depart.] A person who has
   preceded another in the same office. The king, the president, the
   judge, or the magistrate, follows the steps of his predecessor, or he
   does not imitate the example of his predecessors. It is distinguished
   from ancestor, who is of the same blood; but it may perhaps be
   sometimes used for it.

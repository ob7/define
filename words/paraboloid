   PARAB'OLOID, n. [Gr. form.] In geometry, a paraboliform curve whose
   ordinates are supposed to be in the subtriplicate, subquadruplicate,
   &c., ratio of their respective abscissae. Another species is when the
   parameter multiplied into the square of the abscissae, is equal to the
   cube of the ordinate. The curve is then called a semi-cubical
   paraboloid.

   A parabolic conoid. [See conoid.]

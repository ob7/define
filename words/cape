[1]cape

   CAPE, n.

   1. A head land; properly the head, point or termination of a neck of
   land, extending some distance into the sea, beyond the common shore,
   and hence the name is applied to the neck of land itself, indefinitely,
   as in Cape-Cod, Cape-Horn, Cape of Good Hope. It differs from a
   promontory in this, that it may be high or low land; but a promontory
   is a high bold termination of a neck of land.

   2. The neck-piece of a cloke or coat.

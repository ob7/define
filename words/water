   WATER, n. Wauter. [G., Gr.]

   1. A fluid, the most abundant and most necessary for living beings of
   any in nature, except air. Water when pure, is colorless, destitute of
   taste and smell, ponderous, transparent, and in a very small degree
   compressible. It is reposited in the earth in inexhaustible quantities,
   where it is preserved fresh and cool, and from which it issues in
   springs, which form streams and rivers. But the great reservoirs of
   water on the globe are the ocean, seas and lakes, which cover more than
   three fifths of its surface, and from which it is raised by
   evaporation, and uniting with the air in the state of vapor, is wafted
   over the earth, ready to be precipitated in the form of rain, snow or
   hail.

   Water by the abstraction or loss of heat becomes solid, or in other
   words, is converted into ice or snow; and by heat it is converted into
   steam, an elastic vapor, one of the most powerful agents in nature.
   Modern chemical experiments prove that water is a compound substance,
   consisting of a combination of oxygen and hydrogen gases, or rather the
   bases or ponderable matter of those gases; or about two volumes or
   measures of hydrogen gas and one of oxygen gas. The proportion of the
   ingredients in weight, is nearly 85 parts of oxygen to 15 of hydrogen.

   2. The ocean; a sea; a lake; a river; any great collection of water; as
   in the phrases, to go by water, to travel by water.

   3. Urine; the animal liquor secreted by the kidneys and discharged from
   the bladder.

   4. The color or luster of a diamond or pearl, sometimes perhaps of
   other precious stones; as a diamond of the first water, that is,
   perfectly pure and transparent. Hence the figurative phrase, a man or a
   genius of the first water, that is, of the first excellence.

   5. Water is a name given to several liquid substances or humors in
   animal bodies; as the water of the pericardium, of dropsy, &c.

   Mineral waters, are those waters which are so impregnated with foreign
   ingredients, such as gaseous, sulphurous and saline substances, as to
   give them medicinal, or at least sensible properties. Most natural
   waters contain more or less of these foreign substances, but the
   proportion is generally too minute to affect the senses.

   To hold water, to be sound or tight. [Obsolete or vulgar.]

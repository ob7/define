   STEP-SON, n. A son-in-law, [an orphan son.]

   [In the foregoing explication of step, I have followed Lye. The D. And
   G. Write stief, and the Swedes styf, before the name; a word which does
   not appear to be connected with any verb signifying to bereave, and the
   word is not without some difficulties. I have given the explanation
   which appears to be most probably correct. If the radical sense of
   step, a pace, is to part or open, the word coincides with Sax. Stepan,
   to deprive, and in the compounds above, step may imply removal or
   distance.]

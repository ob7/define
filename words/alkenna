   ALKEN'NA or ALHEN'NA, n. Egyptian privet, a species of Lawsonia. The
   pulverized leaves of this plant are much used by the eastern nations
   for staining their nails yellow. The powder, being wet, forms a paste,
   which is bound on the nails for a night, and the color thus given will
   last several weeks.

   JUSTIFICA'TION, n.

   1. The act of justifying; a showing to be just or conformable to law,
   rectitude or propriety; vindication; defense. The court listened to the
   evidence and arguments in justification of the prisoner's conduct. Our
   disobedience to God's commands admits no justification.

   2. Absolution.

   I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote this but as an essay
   of my virtue.

   3. In law, the showing of a sufficient reason in court why a defendant
   did what he is called to answer. Pleas in justification must set forth
   some special matter.

   4. In theology, remission of sin and absolution from guilt and
   punishment; or an act of free grace by which God pardons the sinner and
   accepts him as righteous, on account of the atonement of Christ.

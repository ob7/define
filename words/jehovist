[1]jehovist

   JEHO'VIST, n. Among critics, one who maintains that the vowel-points
   annexed to the word Jehovah in Hebrew, are the proper vowels of the
   word and express the true pronunciation. The Jehovists are opposed to
   the Adonists, who hold that the points annexed to the word Jehovah, are
   the vowels of the word Adonai.

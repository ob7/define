   BRING, v.t.

   1. To fetch; to bear, convey or lead from a distant to a nearer place,
   or to a person; as, bring me a book from the shelf; bring me a morsel
   of bread. In this sense, it is opposed to carry, and it is applied to
   the person bearing or leading, in opposition to sending or transmitting
   by another.

   2. To produce; to procure as a cause; to draw to.

   Nothing brings a man more honor than to be invariably just.

   3. To attract or draw along.

   company, or at the same time; as, to bring a boat over a river; to

   and implying previous remoteness, aversion, alienation, or
   disagreement; as, to bring the mind to assent to a proposition; or to

   nearly equivalent to persuade, prevail upon, or induce. The same
   process is effected by custom, and other causes. Habit brings us to
   relish things at first disagreeable; reflection brings a man to his
   senses, and whether the process is slow or rapid,the sense of the verb
   is the same. To bring to the mind any thing before and forgotten, is to
   recall; but the sense of bring is the same.

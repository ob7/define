[1]ass

   'ASS, n. [L. asinus; Gr. an ear.]

   1. A quadruped of the equine genus. This animal has long slouching
   ears, a short mane, and a tail covered with long hairs at the end. He
   is usually of an ash color, with a black bar across the shoulders. The
   tame or domestic ass is patient to stupidity, and carries a heavy
   burden. He is slow, but very sure footed, and for this reason very
   useful on rough steep hills.

   2. A dull, heavy, stupid fellow; a dolt.

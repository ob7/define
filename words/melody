   MEL'ODY, n. [Gr. a limb, or a song, an ode; L. melos.]

   An agreeable succession of sounds; a succession of sounds so regulated
   and modulated as to please the ear. To constitute melody, the sounds
   must be arranged according to the laws of rhythms, measure, or the due
   proportion of the movements to each other. Melody differs from harmony,
   as it consists in the agreeable succession and modulation of sounds by
   a single voice; whereas harmony consists in the accordance of different
   voices or sounds. Melody is vocal or instrumental.

   To make melody in the heart, to praise God with a joyful and thankful
   disposition, ascribing to him the honor due to his name. Eph.5.

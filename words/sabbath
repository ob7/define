[1]sabbath

   SABBATH, n.

   1. The day which God appointed to be observed by the Jews as a day of
   rest from all secular labor or employments, and to be kept holy and
   consecrated to his service and worship. This was originally the seventh
   day of the week, the day on which God rested from the work of creation;
   and this day is still observed by the Jews and some christians, as the
   sabbath. But the christian church very early begun and still continue
   to observe the first day of the week, in commemoration of the
   resurrection of Christ on that day, by which the work of redemption was
   completed. Hence it is often called the Lords day. The heathen nations
   in the north of Europe dedicated this day to the sun, and hence their
   christian descendants continue to call the day Sunday. But in the
   United States, christians have to a great extent discarded the heathen
   name, and adopted the Jewish name sabbath.

   2. Intermission of pain or sorrow; time of rest.

   Peaceful sleep out the sabbath of the tomb.

   3. The sabbatical year among the Israelites. Lev. 25.

    LAKE, n. [L. lacus. A lake is a stand of water, from the root of lay.
                       Hence L. lagena, Eng. flagon.]

   1. A large and extensive collection of water contained in a cavity or
   hollow of the earth. It differs from a pond in size, the latter being a
   collection of small extent; but sometimes a collection of water is
   called a pond or a lake indifferently. North America contains some of
   the largest lakes on the globe, particularly the lakes Ontario, Erie,
   Huron, Michigan and Superior.

   2. A middle color between ultramarine and vermilion, made of cochineal.

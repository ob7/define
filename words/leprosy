[1]leprosy

   LEP'ROSY, n. [See Leper.] A foul cutaneous disease, appearing in dry,
   white, thin, scurfy scabs, attended with violent itching. It sometimes
   covers the whole body, rarely the face. One species of it is called
   elephantiasis.

   The term leprosy is applied to two very distinct diseases, the scaly
   and the tuberculated, or the proper leprosy and the elephantiasis. The
   former is characterized by smooth laminated scales, sometimes livid,
   but usually whitish; in the latter, the skin is thickened, livid and
   tuberculated. It is called the black leprosy, but this term is also
   applied to the livid variety of the scaly leprosy.

                                  COLD, n.

   1. The sensation produced in animal bodies by the escape of heat, and
   the consequent contraction of the fine vessels. Also, the cause of that
   sensation. Heat expands the vessels, and cold contracts them; and the
   transition from an expanded to a contracted state is accompanied with a
   sensation to which, as well as to the cause of it, we give the
   denomination of cold. Hence cold is a privation of heat, or the cause
   of it.

   2. A shivering; the effect of the contraction of the fine vessels of
   the body; chilliness, or chillness.

   3. A disease; indisposition occasioned by cold; catarrh.

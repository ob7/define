[1]dissatisfactory

   DISSATISFACTORY, a. Unable to give content. Rather, giving discontent;
   displeasing.

   To have reduced the different qualifications, in the different states,
   to one uniform rule, would probably have been as dissatisfactory to
   some of the states, as difficult for the convention.

   ELEPHANTI'ASIS, n. [L.and Gr. from elephant.]

   A species of leprosy, so called from covering the skin with
   incrustations, like those of an elephant. It is a chronic and
   contagious disease, marked by a thickening and greasiness of the legs,
   with loss of hair and feeling, a swelling of the face, and a hoarse,
   nasal voice. It affects the whole body; the bones, as well as the skin,
   are covered with spots and tumors, at first red, but afterwards black.

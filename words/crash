   CRASH, v.t. To break; to bruise.

   CRASH, v.i. To make the loud, clattering, multifarious sound of many
   things falling and breaking at once.

   When convulsions cleave the labring earth, before the dismal yawn
   appears, the ground trembles and heaves, the nodding houses crash.

   CRASH, n. The loud mingled sound of many things falling and breaking at
    once; as the sound of a large tree falling and its branches breaking,
                      or the sound of a falling house.

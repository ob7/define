   PREROG'ATIVE-COURT, n. In Great Britain, a court for the trial of all
   testamentary causes, where the deceased has left bona notabilia, or
   effects of the value of five pounds, in two different dioceses. In this
   case, the probate of the will belongs to the metropolitan or archbishop
   of the province, and the court where such will is proved is called the
   prerogative-court, as it is held by virtue of the special prerogative
   of the metropolitan, who appoints the judge.

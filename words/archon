   'ARCHON, n. [Gr. a prince.]

   The archons in Greece were chief magistrates chosen, after the death of
   Codrus, from the most illustrious families, to superintend civil and
   religious concerns. They were nine in number; the first was properly
   the archon; the second was called king; the third, polemarch, or
   general of the forces. The other six were called thesmothetae, or
   legislators.

   VERAC'ITY, n. [L. verax, from verus, true.]

   1. Habitual observance of truth, or habitual truth; as a man of
   veracity. His veracity is not called in question. The question of the
   court is, whether you know the witness to be a man of veracity. We rely
   on history, when we have confidence in the veracity and industry of the
   historian.

   "The veracity of facts." is not correct language. Truth is applicable
   to men and to facts; veracity to men only, or to sentient beings.

   2. Invariable expression of truth; as the veracity of our senses.

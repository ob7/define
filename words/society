   SOCI'ETY, n. [L. societas, from socius, a companion. See Sociable.]

   1. The union of a number of rational beings; or a number of persons
   united, either for a temporary or permanent purpose. Thus the
   inhabitants of a state or of a city constitute a society, having common
   interests; and hence it is called a community. In a more enlarged
   sense, the whole race or family of man is a society, and called human
   society. The true and natural foundation of society, are the wants and
   fears of individuals.

   2. Any number of persons associated for a particular purpose, whether
   incorporated by law, or only united by articles of agreement; a
   fraternity. Thus we have bible societies for various objects; societies
   for mechanics, and leaned societies; societies for encouraging arts,
   &c.

   3. Company; a temporary association of persons for profit or pleasure.
   In this sense, company is more generally used.

   4. Conpany; fellowship. We frequent the society of those we love and
   esteem.

   5. Partnership; fellowship; union on equal terms. Among unequals what
   society can sort? Heav'n's greatness no society can bear.

   6. Persons living in the same neighborhood, who frequently meet in
   company and have fellowship. Literary society renders a place
   interesting and agreeable.

   7. In Connecticut, a number of families united and incorporated for the
   purpose of supporting public worship, is called an exxlesiastical
   society. This is a parish, except that it has not territorial limits.
   In Massachusetts, such as incorporated society is usually called a
   parish, though consisting of persons only, without regard to territory.

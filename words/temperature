[1]temperature

   TEM'PERATURE, n. [L. temperature.]

   1. In physics, the state of a body with regard to heat or cold, as
   indicated by the thermometer; or the degree of free caloric which a
   body possesses,when compared with other bodies. When a body applied to
   another, either excites the sensation of heat, or expands that body, we
   say it is of a higher temperature; that is, it possesses more free
   caloric. When it excites the sensation of cold, or contracts another
   body, it is said to be of a lower temperature. Thus we speak of the
   temperature of air, of water, of a climate, &c.; two countries of the
   same temperature.

   2. Constitution; state; degree of any quality.

   Memory depends upon the consistence and temperature of the brain.

   3. Moderation; freedom from immoderate passions.

   In that proud port, which her so goodly graceth,

   Most goodly temperature you may descry.

[1]attainable

   ATTA'INABLE, a. That may be attained; that may be reached by efforts of
   the mind or body; that may be compassed or accomplished by efforts
   directed to the object; as, perfection is not attainable in this life.
   From an inattention to the true sense of this word, as explained under
   attain, authors have very improperly used this word for obtainable,
   procurable; as in the following passages. "The kind and quality of food
   and liquor; the species of habitation, furniture and clothing to which
   the common people of each country are habituated, must be attainable
   with ease and certainty." "Gen. Howe would not permit them to be
   purchased in Philadelphia, and they (clothes and blankets) were not
   attainable in the country." Marshall's Life of Washington, 3,428. Each
   of these words should be obtainable.

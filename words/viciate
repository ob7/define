[1]viciate

   VI'CIATE, v.t. [L. vitio. This veb is usually written vitiate; but as
   vice, from L. vitius, is established, it would be well to write the
   verb viciate, as we write appreciate and depreciate, from L. pretium.]

   1. to injure the substance or properties of a thing so as to impair its
   value, and lessen or destroy its use; to make less pure, or wholly
   impure; to deprave, in a physical or moral sense; as, to viciate the
   blood; to viciate taste or style; to viciate morals.

   2. To render defective and thus destroy the validity of; to invalidate
   by defect; as, to viciate a deed or bond.

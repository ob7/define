[1]raddle

   RAD'DLE, v.t.

   To twist; to wind together. [Not in use.]

   RAD'DLE, n. [supra.] A long stick used in hedging; also, a hedge formed
         by interweaving the shoots and branches of trees or shrubs.

   [I believe the two foregoing words are not used in the United States,
   and probably they are local.]

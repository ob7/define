[1]school-house

   SCHOOL'-HOUSE, n. [See House.] A house appropriated for the use of
   schools, or for instruction; but applied only to building for
   subordinate schools, not to colleges. In Connecticut and some other
   states, every town is divided into school-districts, and each district
   erects its own school-house by a tax on the inhabitants.

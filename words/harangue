[1]harangue

   HARANGUE, n. harang'. har'ang.

   1. A speech addressed to an assembly or an army; a popular oration; a
   public address. This word seems to imply loudness or declamation, and
   is therefore appropriated generally to an address made to a popular
   assembly or to an army, and not to a sermon, or to an argument at the
   bar of a court, or to a speech in a deliberative council, unless in
   contempt.

   2. Declamation; a noisy, pompous or irregular address.

       HARANGUE, v.i. harang'. To make an address or speech to a large
                      assembly; to make a noisy speech.

       HARANGUE, v.t. harang'. To address by oration; as, the general
                            harangued the troops.

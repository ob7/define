   LEG'ISLATURE, n. the body of men in a state or kingdom, invested with
   power to make and repeal laws; the supreme power of a state. The
   legislature of Great Britain consists of the house of lords and the
   house of commons with the king, whose sanction is necessary to every
   bill before it becomes a law. The legislatures of most of the states in
   America, consist of two houses or branches, but the sanction of the
   govenor is required to give their acts the force of law, or a
   concurrence of two thirds of the two houses, after he has declined and
   assigned his objections.

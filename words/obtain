   OBTA'IN, v.t. [L. obtineo; ob and teneo, to hold.]

   1. To get; to gain; to procure; in a general sense, to gain possession
   of a thing, whether temporary or permanent; to acquiare. this word
   usually implies exertion to get possession, and in this it differs from
   receive, which may or may not imply exertion. it differs from acquire,
   as genus from species; acquire being properly applied only to things
   permanently possessed; but obtain is applied both to things of
   temporary and of permanent possession. We obtain loans of money on
   application; we obtain answers to letters; we obtain spirit from
   liquors by distillation and salts by evaporation. We obtain by seeking;
   we often receive without seeking. We acquire or obtain a good title to
   lands by deed, or by a judgment of court; but we do not acquire spirit
   by distillation; nor do we acquire an answer to a letter or an
   application.

   He shall obtain the kingdom by flatteries. Dan. 11.

   In whom we have obtained an inheritance. Eph. 1.

   2. To keep; to hold.

                                OBTA'IN, v.i.

   established in practice.

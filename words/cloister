[1]cloister

   CLOISTER, n.

   1. Literally, a close; a close, or inclosed place. A monastery or
   nunnery; a house inhabited by monks or nuns. In a more limited sense,
   the principal part of a regular monastery, consisting of a square,
   erected between the church, the chapter-house and the refectory, and
   over which is the dormitory. The proper use of the cloister is for the
   monks to meet in for conversation. The cloister is square, and has its
   name from being inclosed on its four sides with buildings. Hence in
   architecture, a building is said to be in the form of a cloister, when
   there are buildings on each of the four sides of the court.

   2. A peristyle; a piazza.

                               CLOISTER, v.t.

   1. To confine in a cloister or monastery.

   2. To shut up; to confine closely within walls; to immure; to shut up
   in retirement from the world.

   BILGE, n. [A different orthography of bulge, and belly, a
   protuberance.]

   1. The protuberant part of a cask, which is usually in the middle.

   2. The breadth of a ship's bottom, or that part of her floor which
   approaches to a horizontal direction, on which she would rest, if
   aground. Hence, when this part of a ship is fractured, she is said to
   be bilged.

    BILGE, v.i. To suffer a fracture in the bilge; to spring a leak by a
    fracture in the bilge. The term is used also when a ship has some of
     her timbers struck off by a rock or an anchor, and springs a leak.

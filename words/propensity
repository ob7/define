[1]propensity

   PROPENS'ITY, n. [L. propensio.]

   1. Bent of mind, natural or acquired; inclination; in a moral sense;
   disposition to any thing good or evil, particularly to evil; as a
   propensity to sin; the corrupt propensity of the will.

   It requires critical nicety to find out the genius or propensions of a
   child.

   2. Natural tendency; as the propension of bodies to a particular place.

             [In a moral sense, propensity is now chiefly used.]

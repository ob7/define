[1]monochord

   MON'OCHORD, n. [Gr. sole, only, and chord.] A musical instrument of one
   string. As its name imports, it had originally but one string; but it
   is generally constructed with two, by means of which the musician is
   better enabled to try the proportions of sounds and intervals, and
   judge of the harmony of two tempered notes.

   In the proper sense of the word, a trumpet marine is considered a
   monochord.

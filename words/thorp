[1]thorp

   THORP, [L. tribus.] The primary sense is probably a house, a
   habitation, from fixedness; hence a hamlet, a village, a tribe; as in
   rude ages the dwelling of the head of a family was soon surrounded by
   the houses of his children and descendants. In our language, it occurs
   now only in names of places and persons.

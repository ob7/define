[1]fop

   FOP, n. [The Latin voppa, a senseless fellow, is evidently from the
   same root, with the sense of emptiness or lightness.]

   A vain man of weak understanding and much ostentation; one whose
   ambition is to gain admiration by showy dress and pertness; a gay
   trifling man; a coxcomb.

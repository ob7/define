   GAL'LOP, v.i.

   1. To move or run with leaps, as a horse to run or move with speed.

   But gallop lively down the western hill.

   2. To ride with a galloping pace.

   3. To move very fast; to run over.

   Such superficial ideas he may collect in galloping over it.

     GAL'LOP, n. The movement or pace of a quadruped, particularly of a
     horse,by springs, reaches or leaps. The animal lifts his fore feet
     nearly at the same time, and as these descend and are just ready to
    touch the ground, the hind feet are lifted at once. The gallop is the
      swiftest pace of a horse, but it is also a moderate pace, at the
                            pleasure of a rider.

[1]reverend

   REV'EREND, a. [L. reverendus.]

   1. Worthy of reverence; entitled to respect mingled with fear and
   affection; as reverend and gracious senators.

   A reverend sire among them came.

   [This epithet is, I believe, never applied to the Supreme Being, or to
   his laws or institutions. In lieu of it we use venerable.]

   2. A title of respect given to the clergy or ecclesiastics. We style a
   clergyman reverend; a bishop is styled right reverend; an archbishop
   most reverend. The religious in catholic countries, are styled reverend
   fathers; abbesses, prioresses, &c. reverend mothers. In Scotland, as in
   the United States, the clergy are individually styled reverend. A synod
   is styled very reverend, and the general assembly venerable.

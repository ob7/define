   DEFAULT, n.

   1. A failing, or failure; an omission of that which ought to be done;
   neglect to do what duty or law requires; as, this evil has happened
   through the governors default. A default or fault, may be a crime, a
   vice, or a mere defect, according to the nature of the duty omitted.

   2. Defect; want; failure.

   Cooks could make artificial birds, in default of real ones.

   3. In law, a failure of appearance in court at a day assigned,
   particularly of the defendant in a suit when called to make answer. It
   may be applied to jurors, witnesses, &c.; but a plaintiffs failing to
   appear by himself or attorney, is usually called a non-appearance.

   To suffer default, is to permit an action to be called without
   appearing or answering; applied to a defendant.

   CASTOR, n.

   1. A beaver, an amphibious quadruped, with a flat ovate tail, short
   ears, a blunt nose, small fore feet, and large hind feet.

   2. A reddish brown substance of a strong penetrating smell, taken from
   bags or cods in the groin of the beaver; a powerful antispasmodic.

   3. In astronomy, a moiety of the constellation Gemini, called also
   Apollo.

   Castor and Pollux, in meterology, a fiery meteor, which, at sea,
   appears sometimes adhering to a part of a ship, in the form of one, two
   and even three or four balls. When one is seen alone, it is called
   Helena, which portends that the severest part of the storm is yet to
   come. Two appearing at once are denominated Castor and Pollux, or
   Tyndaridoe, and portend a cessation of the storm.

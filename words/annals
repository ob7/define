[1]annals

   AN'NALS, n. plu. [L. amnales, annalis, from annus, a year, the root of
   which may be the Celtic an, ain, a great circle. Varro says the word
   annus signifies a great circle.]

   1. A species of history digested in order of time, or a relation of
   events in chronological order, each event being recorded under the year
   in which it happened. Annals differ from history, in merely relating
   events, without observations on the motives, causes and consequences,
   which, in history, are more diffusively illustrated.

   2. The books containing annals, as the annals of Tacitus.

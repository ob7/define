   CHEAP, a.

   1. Bearing a low price, in market; that may be purchased at a low
   price; that is, at a price as low or lower than the usual price of the
   article or commodity, or at a price less than the real value. The sense
   is always comparative; for a price deemed cheap at one time is
   considered dear at another.

   It is a principle which the progress of political science has clearly
   established; a principle that illustrates at once the wisdom of the
   creator and the blindness of human cupidity, that it is cheaper to hire
   the labor of freemen than to compel the labor of slaves.

   2. Being of small value; common; not respected; as cheap beauty.

   Make not yourself cheap in the eyes of the world.

     CHEAP, n. Bargain; purchase; as in the phrases, good cheap, better
            cheap; the original phrases from which we have cheap.

[1]all

   ALL, a. awl. [Gr. Shemitic from calah, to be ended or completed to
   perfect.]

   1. Every one, or the whole number of particulars.

   2. The whole quantity, extent, duration, amount, quality, or degree;
   as, all the wheat; all the land; all the year; all the strength. This
   word signifies then, the whole or entire thing, or all the parts or
   particulars which compose it. It always precedes the definitive
   adjectives, the, my, thy, his, our, your, their; as, all the cattle;
   all my labor; all thy goods; all his wealth; all our families; all your
   citizens; all their property.

   This word, not only in popular language, but in the scriptures, often
   signifies, indefinitely, a large portion or number, or a great part.
   Thus, all the cattle in Egypt died; all Judea and all the region round
   about Jordan; all men held John as a prophet; are not to be understood
   in a literal sense, but as including a large part or very great
   numbers.

   This word is prefixed to many other words, to enlarge their
   signification; as already, always, all-prevailing.

   ALL, adv. Wholly; completely; entirely; as all along; all bedewed; all
     over; my friend is all for amusement; I love my father all. In the
      ancient phrases, all too dear, all so long, this word retains its
    appropriate sense; as,"he thought them six-pence all too dear," that
    is, he thought them too dear by the sum of sixpence. In the sense of
    although, as, "all were it as the rest," and in the sense of just, or
    at the moment, as "all as his straying flock he fed," it is obsolete,
                          or restricted to poetry.

   It is all one is a phrase equivalent to the same thing in effect; that
   is, it is wholly the same thing.

   All the better is equivalent to wholly the better; that is, better by
   the whole difference.

                                   ALL, n.

   1. The whole number; as, all have not the same disposition; that is,
   all men.

   2. The whole; the entire thing; the aggregate amount; as, our all is at
   stake.

   And Laban said, all that thou seest is mine. Gen. 31.

   This adjective is much used as a noun, and applied to persons or
   things.

   All in all is a phrase which signifies, all things to a person, or
   every thing desired.

   Thou shalt be all in all, and I in thee, Forever.

   When the words, and all close an enumeration of particulars, the word
   all is either intensive, or is added as a general term to express what
   is not enumerated; as a tree fell, nest, eagles and all.

   At all is a phrase much used by way of enforcement or emphasis, usually
   in negative or interrogative sentences. He has no ambition at all; that
   is, not in the least degree. Has he any property at all?

   All and some, in Spenser, Mason interprets, one and all. But from Lye's
   Saxon dictionary_webster1828, it appears that the phrase is a
   corruption of the Sax. ealle at somne, all together, all at once, from
   somne, together, at once. See Lye under Somne.

   All in the wind, in seamen's language, is a phrase denoting that the
   sails are parallel with the course of the wind, so as to shake.

   All is well is a watchman's phrase, expressing a state of safety.

   All, in composition, enlarges the meaning, or adds force to a word; and
   it is generally more emphatical than most. In some instances, all is
   incorporated into words, as in almighty, already, always; but in most
   instances, it is an adjective prefixed to other words, but separated by
   a hyphen.

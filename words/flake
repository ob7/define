   FLAKE, n. [L. floccus; Gr. Flake and flock are doubtless the same word,
   varied in orthography, and connected perhaps with L. plico, Gr. The
   sense is a complication, a crowd, or a lay.]

   1. A small collection of snow, as it falls from the clouds or from the
   air; a little bunch or cluster of snowy crystals, such as fall in still
   moderate weather. This is a flake, lock or flock of snow.

   2. A platform of hurdles, or small sticks made fast or interwoven,
   supported by stanchions, on which cod-fish is dried.

   White-flake, in painting, is lead corroded by means of the pressing of
   grapes, or a ceruse prepared by the acid of grapes. It is brought from
   Italy, and of a quality superior to common white lead. It is used in
   oil and varnished painting, when a clean white is required.

                      FLAKE, v.t. To form into flakes.

    FLAKE, v.i. To break or separate in layers; to peel or scale off. We
                       more usually say, to flake off.

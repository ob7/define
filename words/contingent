   1. Falling or coming by chance, that is, without design or expectation
   on our part; accidental; casual. On our part, we speak of chance or
   contingencies; but with an infinite being, nothing can be contingent.

   2. In law, depending on an uncertainty; as a contingent remainder.

                               CONTINGENT, n.

   1. A fortuitous event; that which comes without our design, foresight
   or expectation.

   2. That which falls to one in a division or apportionment among a
   number; a quota; an equal or suitable share; proportion. Each prince
   furnishes his contingent of men, money and munitions.

   GANT'LOPE, n. A military punishment inflicted on criminals for some
   heinous offense. It is executed in this manner; soldiers are arranged
   in two rows, face to face, each armed with a switch or instrument of
   punishment; between these rows,the offender, stripped to his waist, is
   compelled to pass a certain number of times, and each man gives him a
   stroke. A similar punishment is used on board of ships. Hence this word
   is chiefly used in the phrase, to run the gantlet or gantlope.

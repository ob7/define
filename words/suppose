   SUPPOSE, v.t. suppo'ze. [L. suppositus, suppono.]

   1. To lay down or state as a proposition or fact that may exist or be
   true, though not known or believed to be true or to exist; or to
   imagine or admit to exist, for the sake of argument or illustration.
   Let us suppose the earth to be the center of the system, what would be
   the consequence?

   When we have as great assurance that a thing is, as we could possibly,
   supposing it were, we ought not to doubt of its existence.

   2. To imagine; to believe; to receive as true.

   Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all young men, the king's
   sons; for Ammon only is dead. 2 Sam.13.

   3. To imagine; to think.

   I suppose,

   If our proposals once again were heard--

   4. To require to exist or be true. The existence of things supposes the
   existence of a cause of the things.

   One falsehood supposes another, and renders all you say suspected.

   5. To put one thing by fraud in the place of another. [Not in use.]

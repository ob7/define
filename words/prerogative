[1]prerogative

   PREROG'ATIVE, [L. proerogativa, precedence in voting; proe, before, and
   rogo, to ask or demand.] An exclusive or peculiar privilege. A royal
   prerogative, is that special pre-eminence which a king has over all
   other persons, and out of the course of the common law, in right of his
   regal dignity. It consists in the possession of certain rights which
   the king may exercise to the exclusion of all participation of his
   subjects; for when a right or privilege is held in common with the
   subject, it ceases to be a prerogative. Thus the right of appointing
   embassadors,and of making peace and war, are, in Great Britain, royal
   prerogatives. The right of governing created beings is the prerogative
   of the Creator.

   It is the prerogative of the house of peers in Great Britain to decide
   legal questions in the last resort. It is the prerogative of the house
   of commons to determine the validity of all elections of their own
   members. It is the prerogative of a father to govern his children. It
   is the prerogative of the understanding to judge and compare.

   In the United States, it is the prerogative of the president, with the
   advice of the senate, to ratify treaties.

   PIPE, n. [Eng. fife.]

   1. A wind instrument of music, consisting of a long tube of wood or
   metal; as a rural pipe. The word, I believe, is not now the proper
   technical name of any particular instrument, but is applicable to any
   tubular wind instrument, and it occurs in bagpipe.

   2. A long tube or hollow body; applied to the veins and arteries of the
   body, and to many hollow bodies, particularly such as are used for
   conductors of water or other fluids.

   3. A tube of clay with a bowl at one end; used in smoking tobacco.

   4. The organs of voice and respiration; as in windpipe.

   5. The key or sound of the voice.

   6. In England, a roll in the exchequer, or the exchequer itself. Hence,
   pipe-office is an office in which the clerk of the pipe makes out
   leases of crown lands, accounts of sheriffs, &c.

   7. A cask containing two hogsheads or 120 gallons, used for wine; or
   the quantity which it contains.

   8. In mining, a pipe is where the ore runs forward endwise in a hole,
   and does not sink downwards or in a vein.

       PIPE, v.i. To play on a pipe, fife, flute or other tubular wind
                            instrument of music.

   We have piped to you, and ye have not danced. Matt.11.

   1. To have a shrill sound; to whistle.

             PIPE, v.t. To play on a wind instrument. 1 Cor.14.

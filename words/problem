   PROB'LEM, n. [L. problema; Gr. to throw forward, and to throw; L.
   pello.] A question proposed.

   1. In logic, a preposition that appears neither absolutely true nor
   false, and consequently may be asserted either in the affirmative or
   negative.

   2. In geometry, a proposition in which some operation or construction
   is required, as to divide a line or an angle, to let fall a
   perpendicular, &c.

   3. In general, any question involving doubt or uncertainty, and
   requiring some operation, experiment or further evidence for its
   solution.

   The problem is, whether a strong and constant belief that a thing will
   be, helps any thing to the effecting of the thing.

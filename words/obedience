[1]obedience

   OBE'DIENCE, n. [L. obedientia. See Obey.]

   Compliance with a command, prohibition or known law and rule of duty
   prescribed; the performance of what is required or enjoined by
   authority, or the abstaining from what is prohibited, in compliance
   with the command or prohibition. To constitute obedience, the act or
   forbearance to act must be in submission to authority; the command must
   be known to the person, and his compliance must be in consequence of
   it, or it is not obedience. Obedience is not synonymous with
   obsequiousness; the latter often implying meanness or servility, and
   obedience being merely a proper submission to authority. That which
   duty requires implies dignity of conduct rather than servility.
   Obedience may be voluntary or involuntary. Voluntary obedience alone
   can be acceptable to God.

   Government must compel the obedience of individuals; otherwise who will
   seek its protection or fear its vengeance?

   INGENU'ITY, n. The quality or power of ready invention; quickness or
   acuteness in combining ideas, or in forming new combinations;
   ingeniousness; skill; used of persons. How many machines for saving
   labor has the ingenuity of men devised and constructed.

   1. Curiousness in design, the effect of ingenuity; as the ingenuity of
   a plan or of mechanism.

   2. Openness of heart; fairness; candor. [This sense of the word was
   formerly common, and is found in good authors down to the age of Locke,
   and even later; but it is now wholly obsolete. In lieu of it,
   ingenousness is used.]

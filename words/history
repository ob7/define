   HIS'TORY, n. [L. historia; Gr. knowing, learned, and to inquire, to
   explore, to learn by inspection or inquiry.]

   1. An account of facts, particularly of facts respecting nations or
   states; a narration of events in the order in which they happened,with
   their causes and effects. History differs from annals. Annals relate
   simply the facts and events of each year, in strict chronological
   order, without any observations of the annalist. History regards less
   strictly the arrangement of events under each year, and admits the
   observations of the writer. This distinction however is not always
   regarded with strictness.

   History is of different kinds, or treats of different subjects; as a
   history of government or political history; history of the christian
   church, or ecclesiastical history; history of war and conquests, or
   military history; history of law; history of commerce; history of the
   crusades, &c. In these and similar examples, history is written
   narrative or relation. What is the history of nations, but a narrative
   of the follies, crimes and miseries of man?

   1. Narration; verbal relation of facts or events; story. We listen with
   pleasure to the soldier or the seaman, giving a history of his
   adventures.

   What histories of toil could I declare?

   2. Knowledge of facts and events.

   History--is necessary to divines.

   3. Description; an account of things that exist; as natural history,
   which comprehends a description of the works of nature, particularly of
   animals, plants and minerals; a history of animals, or zoology; a
   history of plants.

   4. An account of the origin, life and actions of an individual person.
   We say, we have a concise history of the prisoner in the testimony
   offered to the court.

   A formal written account of an individual's life, is called biography.

[1]impiety

   IMPI'ETY, n. [L. impietas;in and pietas, pius.]

   1. Ungodliness; irreverence towards the Supreme being; contempt of the
   divine character and authority; neglect of the divine precepts. These
   constitute different degrees of impiety.

   2. Any act of wickedness,as blasphemy and scoffing at the Supreme
   Being, or at his authority; profaneness. Any expression of contempt for
   God or his laws, constitutes an impiety of the highest degree of
   criminality. Disobedience to the divine commands or neglect of duty
   implies contempt for his authority,and is therefore impiety. Impiety,
   when it expresses the temper or disposition, has no plural; but it is
   otherwise when it expresses an act of wickedness, for all such acts are
   impieties.

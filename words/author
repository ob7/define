[1]author

   AU'THOR, n. [L. auctor. The Latin word is from the root of augeo, to
   increase, or cause to enlarge. The primary sense is one who brings or
   causes to come forth.]

   1. One who produces, creates, or brings into being; as, God is the
   author of the Universe.

   2. The beginner, former, or first mover of any thing; hence, the
   efficient cause of a thing. It is appropriately applied to one who
   composes or writes a book, or original work, and in a more general
   sense, to one whose occupation is to compose and write books; opposed
   to compiler or translator.

              AU'THOR, v.t. To occasion; to effect. [Not used.]

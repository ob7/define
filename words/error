[1]error

   ER'ROR, n. [L. error, from erro, to wander.] A wandering or deviation
   from the truth; a mistake in judgment, by which men assent to or
   believe what is not true. Error may be voluntary, or involuntary.
   Voluntary, when men neglect or pervert the proper means to inform the
   mind; involuntary, when the means of judging correctly are not in their
   power. An error committed through carelessness or haste is a blunder.

   Charge home upon error its most tremendous consequences.

   1. A mistake made in writing or other performance. It is no easy task
   to correct the errors of the press. Authors sometimes charge their own
   errors to the printer.

   2. A wandering; excursion; irregular course.

   Driv'n by the winds and errors of the sea.

               [This sense is unusual and hardly legitimate.]

   3. Deviation from law, justice or right; oversight; mistake in conduct.

   Say not, it was an error. Eccles.5.

   4. In scripture and theology, sin; iniquity; transgression.

   Who can understand his errors? Cleanse thou me from secret faults.
   Ps.19.

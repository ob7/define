[1]hanaper

   HAN'APER, n. The hanaper was used in early days by the kings of
   England, for holding and carrying with them their money, as they
   journeyed from place to place. It was a kind of basket, like the
   fiscus, and hence came to be considered as the king's treasury. Hence,
   the clerk or warden of the hanaper, is an officer who receives the fees
   due to the king for seals of charters, patents, commissions, and writs.
   There is also an officer who is controller of the hanaper. This word
   therefore answered to the modern exchequer.

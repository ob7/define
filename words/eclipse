   ECLIPSE, n. eclips'. [L. eclipsis; Gr. defect, to fail, to leave.]

   1. Literally, a defect or failure; hence in astronomy, an interception
   or obscuration of the light of the sun, moon or other luminous body. An
   eclipse of the sun is caused by the intervention of the moon, which
   totally or partially hides the sun's disk; an eclipse of the moon is
   occasioned by the shadow of the earth, which falls on it and obscures
   it in whole or in part, but does not entirely conceal it.

   2. Darkness; obscuration. We say,his glory has suffered an eclipse.

   All the posterity of our first parents suffered a perpetual eclipse of
   spiritual life.

   ECLIPSE, v.t. eclips'. To hide a luminous body in whole or in part and
            intercept its rays; as, to eclipse the sun or a star.

   1. To obscure; to darken, by intercepting the rays of light which
   render luminous; as, to eclipse the moon.

   2. To cloud; to darken; to obscure; as, to eclipse the glory of a hero.

[1]primogeniture

   PRIMOGEN'ITURE, n. [L. primus, first, and genitus, begotten.

   1. The state of being born first of the same parents; seniority by
   birth among children.

   2. In law, the right which belongs to the eldest son or daughter. Thus
   in Great Britain, the right of inheriting the estate of the father
   belongs to the eldest son, and in the royal family, the eldest son of
   the king is entitled to the throne by primogeniture. Among the females,
   the crown descends by right of primogeniture to the eldest daughter
   only and her issue.

   Before the revolution, primogeniture, in some of the American colonies,
   entitled the eldest son to a double portion of his father's estate, but
   this right has been abolished.

   ARMIN'IAN, a. Pertaining to Arminius, or designating his principles.

   ARMIN'IAN, n. One of a sect or party of Christians, so called from
   Arminius or Harmansen, of Holland, who flourished at the close of the
   16th century, and beginning of the 17th. The Arminian doctrines are,

   1. conditional election and reprobation, in opposition to absolute
   predestination.

   2. Universal redemption, or that the atonement was made by Christ for
   all mankind, though none but believers can be partakers of the benefit.

   3. That man,in order to exercise true faith, must be regenerated and
   renewed by the operation of the Holy Spirit, which is the gift of God;
   but that this grace is not irresistible and may be lost; so that men
   may relapse from a state of grace and die in their sins.

[1]apology

   APOL'OGY, n. [Gr. discourse.]

   An excuse; something said or written in defense or extenuation of what
   appears to others wrong, or unjustifiable; or of what may be liable to
   disapprobation. It may be an extenuation of what is not perfectly
   justifiable, or a vindication of what is or may be disapproved, but
   which the apologist deems to be right. A man makes an apology for not
   fulfilling an engagement, or for publishing a pamphlet. An apology then
   is a reason or reasons assigned for what is wrong or may appear to be
   wrong, and it may be either an extenuation or a justification of
   something that is or may be censured, by those who are not acquainted
   with the reasons.

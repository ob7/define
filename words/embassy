[1]embassy

   EM'BASSY, n.

   1. The message or public function of an embassador; the charge or
   employment of a public minister, whether ambassador or envoy; the word
   signifies the message or commission itself, and the person or persons
   sent to convey or to execute it. We say the king sent an embassy,
   meaning an envoy,minister, or ministers; or the king sent a person on
   an embassy. The embassy consisted of three envoys. The embassy was
   instructed to inquire concerning the king's disposition.

   2. A solemn message.

   Eighteen centuries ago, the gospel went forth from Jerusalem on an
   embassy of mingled authority and love.

   3. Ironically, an errand.

   [The old orthography, ambassade, ambassage, being obsolete, and embassy
   established, I have rendered the orthography of embassador conformable
   to it in the initial letter.]

   AL'MANACK, n.

   A small book or table, containing a calendar of days, weeks and months,
   with the times of the rising of the sun and moon, changes of the moon,
   eclipses, hours of full tide, stated festivals of churches, stated
   terms of courts, observations on the weather, &c. for the year ensuing.
   this calendar is sometimes published on one side of a single sheet, and
   called a sheet-almanack.

   The Baltic nations formerly engraved their calendars on pieces of wood,
   on swords, helves of axes, and various other utensils, and especially
   on walking sticks. many of these are preserved in the cabinets of the
   curious. they are called by different nations, rimstocks, primstories,
   runstocks, runstaffs, clogs, &c.

   The characters used are generally the Runic or Gothic.

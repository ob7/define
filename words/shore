   SHORE, the old. pret. of shear. Obs.

   SHORE, n. The coast or land adjacent to the sea, or to a large lake or
   river. This word is applied primarily to land contiguous to water; but
   it extends to the ground near the border of the sea or of a lake, which
   is covered with water. We also use the word to express the land near
   the border of the sea or of a great lake, to an indefinite extent; as
   when we say, a town stands on the shore. We do not apply the word to
   land contiguous to a small stream. This we call a bank.

   SHORE, n. [The popular but corrupt pronunciation of sewer; a
   pronunciation that should be carefully avoided.]

   SHORE, n. A prop; a butress; something that supports a building or
   other thing.

   SHORE, v.t.

   1. To prop; to support by a post or butress; usually withsup; as, to
   shore up a building.

   2. To set on shore. [Not in use.]

[1]indecorum

   INDECO'RUM, n. [L. in and decorum.] Impropriety of behavior; that in
   behavior or manners which violates the established rules of civility,
   or the duties of respect which age or station requires; an unbecoming
   action. It is sometimes synonymous with indecency; but indecency, more
   frequently than indecorum, is applied to words or actions which refer
   to what nature and propriety require to be concealed or suppressed.

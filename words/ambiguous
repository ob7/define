[1]ambiguous

   AMBIG'UOUS, a. [L. ambiguus.]

   Having two or more meanings; doubtful; being of uncertain
   signification; susceptible of different interpretations; hence,
   obscure. It is applied to words and expressions; not to a dubious state
   of mind, though it may be to a person using words of doubtful
   signification.

   The ancient oracles were ambiguous, as were their answers.

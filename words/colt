[1]colt

   COLT, n.

   1. The young of the equine genus of animals or horse kind. In America,
   colt is equally applied to the male or female, and this is
   unquestionable correct. The male is called a house-colt, and the female
   is called a filly.

   2. A young foolish fellow; a person without experience or stability.

     COLT, v.i. To frisk, riot or frolic, like a colt; to be licentious.

                            COLT, v.t. To befool.

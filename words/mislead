[1]mislead

   MISLE'AD, v.t. pret. and pp. misled. [See Lead.]

   To lead into a wrong way or path; to lead astray; to guide into error;
   to cause to mistake; to deceive.

   Trust not servants who mislead or misinform you,

   But of the two, less dangerous is th' offense,

   To tire our patience, than mislead our sense.

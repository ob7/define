[1]acquit

   ACQUIT', v.t. [L. cedo.]

   To set free; to release or discharge from an obligation, accusation,
   guilt, censure, suspicion, or whatever lies upon a person as a charge
   or duty; as, the jury acquitted the prisoner; we acquit a man of evil
   intentions. It is followed by of before the object; to acquit from is
   obsolete. In a reciprocal sense, as, the soldier acquitted himself well
   in battle, the word has a like sense, implying the discharge of a duty
   or obligation. Hence its use in expressing excellence in performance;
   as the orator acquitted himself well, that is, in a manner that his
   situation and public expectation demanded.

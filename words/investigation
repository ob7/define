[1]investigation

   INVESTIGA'TION, n. [L. investigatio.] The action or process of
   searching minutely for truth, facts or principles; a careful inquiry to
   find out what is unknown, either in the physical or moral world, and
   either by observation and experiment, or by argument and discussion.
   Thus we speak of the investigations of the philosopher and the
   mathematician; the investigations of the judge, the moralist and the
   divine.

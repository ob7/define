   FORBID', v.t. pret. forbad; pp. forbid, forbidden. Literally, to bid or
   command against. Hence,

   1. To prohibit; to interdict; to command to forbear or not to do. The
   laws of God forbid us to swear. Good manners also forbid us to use
   profane language. All servile labor and idle amusements on the sabbath
   are forbidden.

   2. To command not to enter; as, I have forbid him my house or presence.
   This phrase seems to be elliptical; to forbid from entering or
   approaching.

   3. To oppose; to hinder; to obstruct. An impassable river forbids the
   approach of the army.

   A blaze of glory that forbids the sight.

   4. To accurse; to blast. Obs.

     FORBID', v.i. To utter a prohibition; but in the intransitive form,
       there is always an ellipsis. I would go, but my state of health
              forbids, that is, forbids me to go, or my going.

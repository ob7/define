   See Mind.]

   1. The faculty of the mind by which it retains the knowledge of past
   events, or ideas which are past. A distinction is made between memory
   and recollection. Memory retains past ideas without any, or with little

   Memory is the purveyor of reason.

   excite little attention are apt to escape from memory.

   4. The time within which past events can be remembered or recollected,
   or the time within which a person may have knowledge of what is past.
   The revolution in England was before my memory; the revolution in
   America was within the author's memory.

   5. Memorial; monumental record; that which calls to remembrance. A
   monument in London was erected in memory of the conflagration in 1666.

   6. Reflection; attention.

[1]elastical

   ELAS'TICAL, a. [from the Gr. to impel, to drive.] Springing back;
   having the power of returning to the form from which it is bent,
   extended, pressed or distorted; having the inherent property of
   recovering its former figure, after any external pressure, which has
   altered that figure, is removed; rebounding; flying back. Thus a bow is
   elastic, and when the force which bends it is removed, it instantly
   returns to its former shape. The air is elastic; vapors are elastic;
   and when the force compressing them is removed, they instantly expand
   or dilate, and recover their former state.

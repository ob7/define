[1]chabasite

   CHABASITE, n. A mineral which has been regarded as a variety of
   zeolite. It is divisible into very obtuse rhomboids.

   This mineral occurs in crystals, whose primitive form is nearly a cube.

   Chabasie has a foliated structure; its fracture is somewhat conchoidal
   or uneven, with a glistening vitreous luster. It is translucent,
   sometimes transparent. Its color is white or grayish white, sometimes
   with a rosy tinge. Before the blowpipe, it intumesces a little, and
   easily melts into a white spongy mass.

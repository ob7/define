[1]osmium

   OS'MIUM, n. [Gr. odor.] A metal recently discovered, and contained in
   the ore of platinum. A native alloy of this metal with iridium is found
   in grains along the rivers in South America. Osmium has a dark gray
   color; it is not volatile when heated in close vessels, but heated in
   the open air, it absorbs oxygen and forms a volatile oxyd. It is
   insoluble in the acids, readily soluble in potassa and very volatile.
   It takes its name from the singular smell of its oxyd.

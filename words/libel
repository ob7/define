[1]libel

   LI'BEL, n. [L. libellus, a little book, from liber, a book, from the
   sense of bark, and this from stripping separating. Hence liber, a book,
   and liber, free, are the same word.]

   1. A defamatory writing, L. libellus, famosus. Hence, the epithet being
   omitted, libel expresses the same thing. Any book, pamphlet, writing or
   picture, containing representations, maliciously made or published,
   tending to bring a person into contempt, or expose him to public hatred
   and derision. The communication of such defamatory writing to a single
   person, is considered in law a publication. It is immaterial with
   respect to the essence of a libel, whether the matter of it is true or
   false, since the provocation and not the falsity is the thing to be
   punished criminally. But in a civil action, a libel must appear to be
   false, as well as scandalous.

   In a more extensive sense, any blasphemous, treasonable or immoral
   writing or picture made public, is a libel, and punishable by law.

   2. In the civil law, and in courts of admiralty, a declaration or
   charge in writing exhibited in court, particularly against a ship or
   goods, for violating the laws of trade or of revenue.

                                LI'BEL, v.t.

   1. To defame or expose to public hatred and contempt by a writing or
   picture; to lampoon.

   Some wicked wits have libeled all the fair.

   2. To exhibit a charge against any thing in court, particularly against
   a ship or goods, for a violation of the laws of trade or revenue.

   LI'BEL, v.i. To spread defamation, written or printed; with against. He

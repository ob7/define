[1]would

   WOULD, WUD, pret. of will, G., L.

   Would is used as an auxiliary verb in conditional forms of speech. I
   would go, if I could. This form of expression denotes will or
   resolution, under a condition or supposition. You would go, He would
   go, denote simply an event, under a condition or supposition. The
   condition implied in would is not always expressed. By pleasure and
   pain, I would be understood to mean what delights or molests us--; that
   is, if it should be asked what I mean by pleasure and pain, I would
   thus explain what I wish to have understood. In this form of
   expression, which is very common, there seems to be an implied allusion
   to an inquiry, or to the supposition of something not expressed.

   Would has the sense of wish or pray, particularly in the phrases, would
   to God, would God we had died in Egypt, I would that ye knew what
   conflict I have; that is, I could wish such a thing, if the wish could
   avail. Here also there is an implied condition.

   Would is used also for wish to do, or to have. What wouldst thou? What
   would he?

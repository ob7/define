[1]husk

   HUSK, n. The external covering of certain fruits or seeds of plants. It
   is the calyx of the flower or glume of corn and grasses, formed of
   valves embracing the seed. The husks of the small grains, when
   separated, are called chaff; but in America we apply the word chiefly
   to the covering of the ears or seeds of maiz, which is never
   denominated chaff. It is sometimes used in England for the rind, skin
   or hull of seeds.

   HUSK, v.t. To strip off the external integument or covering of the
   fruits or seeds of plants; as, to husk maiz.

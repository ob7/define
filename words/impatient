   IMPA'TIENT, a. [L. impatiens.] Uneasy or fretful under suffering; not
   bearing pain with composure; not enduring evil without
   fretfulness,uneasiness, and a desire or effort to get rid of the evil.
   Young men are impatient of restraint. We are all apt to be impatient
   under wrongs; but it is a christian duty not to be impatient in
   sickness, or under any afflictive dispensation of Providence.

   1. Not suffering quietly; not enduring.

   Fame, impatient of extremes, decays

   Not more by envy than excess of praise.

   2. Hasty; eager; not enduring delay. The impatient man will not wait
   for information; he often acts with precipitance. Be not impatient for
   the return of spring.

   3. Not to be borne; as impatient smart.

     This word is followed by of, at, for, or under. We are impatient of
      restraint, or of wrongs; impatient at the delay of expected good;
    impatient for the return of a friend, or for the arrival of the mail;
    impatient under evils of any kind. The proper use of these particles
               can be learnt only by practice or observation.

             IMPA'TIENT, n. One who is restless under suffering.

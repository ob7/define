   ANACLAS'TIC, a. [Gr. breaking, from to break.]

   Refracting; breaking the rectilinear course of light.

   Anaclastic glasses, sonorous glasses or phials, which are flexible, and
   emit a vehement noise by means of the human breath; called also vexing
   glasses, from the fright which their resilience occasions. They are low
     phials with flat bellies, like inverted tunnels, and with very thin
   convex bottoms. By drawing out a little air, the bottom springs into a
   concave form with a smart crack; and by breathing or blowing into them,
     the bottom, with a like noise, springs into its former convex form.

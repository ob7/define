   ORYCTOG'NOSY, n. [Gr. fossil, and knowledge.]

   That branch of mineralogy which has for its object the classification
   of minerals, according to well ascertained characters, and under
   appropriate denominations.

   Oryctognosy consists in the description of minerals, the determination
   of their nomenclature, and the systematic arrangement of their
   different species. It coincides nearly with mineralogy, in its modern
   acceptation.

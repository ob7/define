[1]unless

   UNLESS', conj.

   Except; that is, remove or dismiss the fact or thing stated in the
   sentence or clause which follows. "We cannot thrive unless we are
   industrious and frugal." the sense will be more obvious with the
   clauses of the sentence inverted. Unless, [remove this fact, suppose it
   not to exist,] we are industrious and frugal, we cannot thrive. Unless
   then answers for a negation. If we are not industrious, we cannot
   thrive.

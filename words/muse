   MUSE, n. s as z. [L. musa.]

   1. Properly, song; but in usage, the deity or power of poetry. Hence
   poets in modern times, as in ancient, invoke the aid of the Muse or
   Muses, or in other words,the genius of poetry.

   Granville commands; your aid, O Muses, bring,

   What Muse for Granville can refuse to sing?

   2. Deep thought; close attention or contemplation which abstracts the
   minds from passing scenes; hence sometimes, absence of mind.

   As in great muse, no word to creature spake.

   He was fill'd

   With admiration and deep muse to hear

   Of things so high and strange.

      MUSE, v.i. s as z. [L. musso and mussito, to mutter or murmur, to
   demur, to be silent. The Greek signifies to press, or utter sound with
   the lips compressed. The latter verb belongs to a sound uttered through
   the nose or with close lips, or of the same family, L. mussitatio. The
   word then primarily denotes what we call humming, to hum, as persons do
                 when idle, or alone and steadily occupied.]

   1. To ponder; to think closely; to study in silence.

   He mused upon some dangerous plot.

   I muse on the works of thy hands. Ps.143.

   2. To be absent in mind; to be so occupied in study or contemplation,
   as not to observe passing scenes or things present.

   3. To wonder.

   Do not muse of me.

                   MUSE, v.t. To think on; to meditate on.

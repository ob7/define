   LOT, n.

   1. That which, in human speech, is called chance, hazard, fortune; but
   in strictness of language, is the determination of Providence; as, the
   land shall be divided by lot. Num. 26.

   2. That by which the fate or portion of one is determined; that by
   which an event is committed to chance, that is, to the determination of
   Providence; as, to cast lots; to draw lots.

   The lot is cast into the lap, but the whole disposing thereof is of the
   Lord. Prov. 16.

   3. The part, division or fate which falls to one by chance, that is, by
   divine determination.

   4. A distinct portion or parcel; as a lot of goods; a lot of boards.

   5. Proportion or share of taxes; as, to pay scot and lot.

   6. In the United States, a piece or division of land; perhaps
   originally assigned by drawing lots, but now any portion, piece or
   division. So we say, a man has a lot of land in Broadway, or in the
   meadow; he has a lot in the plain, or on the mountain; he has a
   home-lot, a house-lot, a wood-lot.

   To cast lots, is to use or throw a die, or some other instrument, by
   the unforseen turn or position of which, an event is by previous
   agreement determined.

   To draw lots, to determine an event by drawing one thing from a number
   whose marks are concealed from the drawer, and thus determining an
   event.

   LOT, v.t. To allot; to assign; to distribute; to sort; to catalogue; to
                                  portion.

[1]bay

   BAY, a. [L.badius. Blass Bd.] Red, or reddish, inclining to a chestnut
   color; applied to the color of horses. The shades of this color are
   called light bay, dark bay, dappled bay, gilded bay, chestnut bay. In
   popular language, in England, all bay horses are called brown.

   BAY, n.

   1. An arm of the sea, extending into the land, not of any definite
   form, but smaller than a gulf, and larger than a creek. The
   name,however, is not used with much precision, and is often applied to
   large tracts of water, around which the land forms a curve, as Hudson's
   Bay. Nor is the name restricted to tracts of water with a narrow
   entrance, but used for any recess or inlet between capes of head lands,
   as the bay of Biscay.

   2. A pond-head,or a pond formed by a dam, for the purpose of driving
   mill-wheels. [ I believe not used in U.S.]

   3. In a barn, a place between the floor and the end of the building, or
   a low inclosed place, for depositing hay.

   In England, says Johnson, if a barn consists of a floor and two heads,
    where they lay corn, they call it a barn of two bays. These bays are
      from 14 to 20 feet long, and floors from 10 to 12 feet broad, and
           usually 20 feet long, which is the breadth of the barn.

   4. In ships of war, that part on each side between decks which lies
   between the bitts.

   5. Any kind of opening in walls.

   MAS'SACRE, n.

   1. The murder of an individual, or the slaughter of numbers of human
   beings, with circumstances of cruelty; the indiscriminate killing of
   human beings, without authority or necessity, and without forms civil
   or military. It differs from assassination, which is a private killing.
   It differs from carnage, which is rather the effect of slaughter than
   slaughter itself, and is applied to the authorized destruction of men
   in battle. Massacre is sometimes called butchery, from its resemblance
   to the killing of cattle. If a soldier kills a man in battle in his own
   defense, it is a lawful act; it is killing, and it is slaughter, but it
   is not a massacre. Whereas, if a soldier kills an enemy after he has
   surrendered, it is a massacre, a killing without necessity, often
   without authority, contrary to the usages of nations, and of course
   with cruelty. The practice of killing prisoners, even when authorized
   by the commander, is properly massacre; as the authority given proceeds
   from cruelty. We have all heard of the massacre of the protestants in
   France, in the reign of Charles IX. and frequent instances of barbarous
   massacre occur in the war between the Turks and Greeks.

   2. Murder.

   WOUND, n. [G.]

   1. A breach of the skin and flesh of an animal, or of the bark and wood
   of a tree, or of the bark and substance of other plants, caused by
   violence or external force. The self-healing power of living beings,
   animal or vegetable, by which the parts separated in wounds, tend to
   unite and become sound, is a remarkable proof of divine benevolence and
   wisdom.

   2. Injury; hurt; as a wound given to credit or reputation.

    WOUND, v.t. To hurt by violence; as, to wound the head or the arm; to
                                wound a tree.

   He was wounded for our transgressions. Isaiah 53.

                        WOUND, pret. and pp. of wind.

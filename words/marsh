[1]marsh

   M`ARSH, n. A tract of low land, usually or occasionally covered with
   water, or very wet and miry, and overgrown with coarse grass or with
   detached clumps of sedge; a fen. It differs from swamp, which is merely
   moist or spungy land, but often producing valuable crops of grass.
   Lowland occasionally overflowed by the tides, is called salt marsh.

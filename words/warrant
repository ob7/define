   WARRANT, v.t. [The primary sense of the root is to stop or hold, or to
   repel, and thus guard by resisting danger; as we say, to keep off.
   Hence the sense of security. See Guard and Garrison.]

   1. To authorize; to give authority or power to do or forbear any thing,
   by which the person authorized is secured or saved harmless from any
   loss or damage by the act. A commission warrants an officer to seize an
   enemy. We are not warranted to resist legitimate government. Except in
   extreme cases.

   2. To maintain; to support by authority or proof.

   Reason warrants it, and we may safely receive it as true.

   3. To justify.

   True fortitude is seen in great exploits, that justice warrants, and
   that wisdom guides.

   4. To secure; to exempt; to privilege..

   Ill warrant him from drowning.

   In a place less warranted than this, or less secure, I cannot be--

   5. To declare with assurance.

   My neck is as smooth as silk, I warrant ye.

   6. In law, to secure to a grantee an estate granted; to assure.

   7. To secure to a purchaser of goods the title to the same; or to
   indemnify him against loss.

   8. To secure to a purchaser the good quality of the goods sold. [See
   Warranty.]

   9. To assure that a thing is what it appears to be, which implies a
   covenant to make good any defect or loss incurred by it.

                                 WARRANT, n.

   1. An act, instrument or obligation, by which one person authorizes
   another to do something which he has not otherwise a right to do; an
   act or instrument investing one with a right or authority, and thus
   securing him from loss or damage; a word of general application.

   2. A precept authorizing an officer to seize an offender and bring him
   to justice. A general warrant to seize suspected persons, is illegal.

   3. Authority; power that authorizes or justifies any act. Those who
   preach the gospel have the warrant of Scripture. We have the warrant of
   natural right to do what the laws do not forbid; but civility and
   propriety may sometimes render things improper, which natural right
   warrants.

   4. A commission that gives authority, or that justifies.

   5. A voucher; that which attests or proves.

   6. Right; legality.

   Theres warrant in that theft which steals itself when theres no mercy
   left.

   7. A writing which authorizes a person to receive money or other thing.

   Warrant of attorney, that by which a man appoints another to act in his
   name, and warrants his transaction.

   Land warrant, is an instrument or writing issued by the proper officer,
   authorizing a person to locate or take up a tract of new or
   uncultivated land.

   Search warrant, a precept authorizing a person to enter houses, shops,
   &c. to search for a criminal, for stolen or smuggled goods.

   Warrant officer, an officer holding a warrant from the navy board, such
   as the master, surgeon, purser, &c. of a ship.

   IN'CIDENCE, n. [L. incidens; incido, to fall on; in and cado, to fall.]

   1. Literally, a falling on; whence, an accident or casualty.

   2. The manner of falling on, or the direction in which one body falls
   on or strikes another. The angle which the line of falling, or the
   direction of a moving body striking another, makes with the place
   struck, is called the angle of incidence. When rays of light striking a
   body are reflected,the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection
   are equal.

   In equal incidences there is a considerable inequality of refractions.

[1]pyrite

   PYRITE, n. plu. pyrites. [Gr., fire.] Fire-stone; a genus of
   inflammable substances composed of sulphur and iron or other metal; a
   sulphuret of iron or other metal.

   Hence sable coal his massy couch extends, and stars of gold the
   sparkling pyrite blends.

   [I have anglicized this word, according to Darwin and the French
   mineralogists; making pyrites a regular plural.]

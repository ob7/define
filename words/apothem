[1]apothem

   AP'OTHEM, n. [Gr. from, and word. It would be eligible to reduce this
   harsh word to apothem.]

   A remarkable saying; a short, sententious, instructive remark, uttered
   on a particular occasion, or by a distinguished character; as that of
   Cyrus, "He is unworthy to be a magistrate, who is not better than his
   subjects;" or that of Cato, men by doing nothing, soon learn to do
   mischief.

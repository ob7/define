   EARTH, n. erth.

   1. Earth, in its primary sense, signifies the particles which compose
   the mass of the globe, but more particularly the particles which form
   the fine mold on the surface of the globe; or it denotes any indefinite
   mass or portion of that matter. We throw up earth with a spade or plow;
   we fill a pit or ditch with earth; we form a rampart with earth. This
   substance being considered, by ancient philosophers, as simple, was
   called an element; and in popular language, we still hear of the four
   elements, fire, air,earth, and water.

   2. In chimistry, the term earth was, till lately, employed to denote a
   simple elementary body or substance, tasteless, inodorous,
   uninflammable and infusible. But it has also been applied to substances
   which have a very sensible alkaline taste, as lime. The primitive
   earths are reckoned ten in number, viz, silex, alumin, lime, magnesia,
   baryte, strontian, zircon, glucin, yttria and thorina. Recent
   experiments prove that most or all of them are compounds of oxygen with
   bases, some of which appear to possess the properties of metals. In
   this case the earths are to be considered as metallic oxyds.

   3. The terraqueous globe which we inhabit. The earth is nearly
   spherical, but a little flatted at the poles, and hence its figure is
   called an oblate spheroid. It is one of the primary planets, revolving
   round the sun in an orbit which is between those of Venus and Mars. It
   is nearly eight thousand miles in diameter, and twenty five thousand
   miles in circumference. Its distance from the sun is about ninety five
   millions of miles,and its annual revolution constitutes the year of 365
   days, 5 hours, and nearly 49 minutes.

   4. The world, as opposed to other scenes of existence.

   5. The inhabitants of the globe.

   The whole earth was of one language. Gen.11.

   6. Dry land, opposed to the sea.

   God called the dry land earth. Gen.1.

   7. Country; region; a distinct part of the globe.

   In this sense, land or soil is more generally used.

   In scripture, earth is used for a part of the world. Ezra. 1.2.

   8. The ground; the surface of the earth. He fell to the earth. The ark
   was lifted above the earth.

   In the second month--was the earth dried. Gen.8.

   9. In scripture, things on the earth, are carnal, sensual, temporary
   things; opposed to heavenly, spiritual or divine things.

                 10. Figuratively, a low condition. Rev.12.

    11. [from ear, L. aro, to plow.] The act of turning up the ground in
                            tillage. [Not used.]

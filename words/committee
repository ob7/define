[1]committee

   COMMITTEE, n. One or more persons, elected or appointed, to whom any
   matter or business is referred, either by a legislative body or either
   branch of it, or by a court, or by an corporation, or by any society,
   or collective body of men acting together. In legislative bodies, a
   house or branch of that body may resolve or form itself into a
   committee, called a committee of the whole hose, when the speaker
   leaves the chair, and one of the members acts as chairman. Standing
   committees are such as continue during the existence of the
   legislature, and to these are committed all matters that fall within
   the purposes of their appointment; as the committee of elections, or of
   privileges, &c. Special committees are appointed to consider and report
   on particular subjects.

[1]ladanum

   LAD'ANUM, n. The resinous juice which exsudes from the leaves of the
   Cistus ladanifera, a shrub which grows in Arabia, Candia, and other
   parts of the Archipelago. It is collected with a kind of rake, with
   leather thongs attached to it, with which the shrubs are brushed. The
   best sort is in dark-colored black masses, of the consistence of a soft
   plaster. The other sort is in long rolls coiled up, harder than the
   former, and of a paler color. It is chiefly used in external
   applications.

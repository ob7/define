   VOM'IT, v.i. [L. vomo. probably the Gr. is the same word, with the loss
   of its first letter.]

   To eject the contents of the stomach by the mouth. Some persons vomit
   with ease, as do cats and dogs. But horses do not vomit.

                                VOM'IT, v.t.

   1. To throw up or eject from the stomach; to discharge from the stomach
   through the mouth. It is followed often by up or out, but without
   necessity and to the injury of the language. In the yellow fever, the
   patients often vomit dark colored matter, like coffee grounds.

   The fish vomited out Jonah upon the dry land. Jonah 2.

   2. To eject with violence from any hollow place. Volcanoes vomit
   flames, ashes, stones and liquid lava.

                                 VOM'IT, n.

   2. That which excites the stomach to discharge its contents; an emetic.

   Black vomit, the dark colored matter ejected from the stomach in the
   last stage of the yellow fever or other malignant disease; hence, the
   yellow fever, vulgarly so called.

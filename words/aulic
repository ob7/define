[1]aulic

   AU'LIC, a. [L. audicus, from aula, a hall, court or palace; Gr.]

   Pertaining to a royal court. The epithet is probably confined to the
   German Empire, where it is used to designate certain courts or officers
   composing the courts. The aulic council is composed of a president, who
   is a catholic, a vice-chancellor and eighteen counsellors, nine of whom
   are protestants, and nine catholics. They always follow the Emperor's
   court, and decide without an appeal. This council ceases at the death
   of the Emperor.

   The Aulic, in some European universities, is an act of a young divine,
   on being admitted a doctor of divinity. It begins by a harangue of the
   chancellor addressed to the young doctor, after which he receives the
   cap and presides at the Aulic or disputation.

[1]shall

   SHALL,

   1. Shall is primarily in the present, and in our mother tongue was
   followed by a verb in the infinitive, like other verbs. "Ic sceal fram
   the beon gefullod." I have need to be baptized of thee. "Ic nu sceal
   singan sar-cwidas." I must now sing mornful songs.

   We still use shall and should before another verb in the infinitive,
   without the sign to; but significance of shall is considerably
   deflected from its primitive sense. It is now treated as a mere
   auxiliary to other verbs, serving to form some of the tenses. In the
   present tense, shall, before a verb in the infinitive, forms the future
   tense; but its force and effect are different with different persons or
   personal pronouns. Thus in the first person, shall simply foretells or
   declares what will take place; as, I or we shall ride to town on
   Monday. This declaration simply informs another of a fact that is to
   take place. The sense of shall here is changed from an expression of
   need or duty, to that of previous statement or information, grounded on
   intention or resolution. When uttered with emphasis, "I shall go," it
   expresses firm determination, but not a promise.

   2. In the second and third persons, shall implies a promise, command or
   determination. "You shall receive your wages," "he shall receive his
   wages," imply that you or he ought to receive them; but usage gives
   these phrases the force of a promise in the person uttering them.

   When shall is uttered with emphasis in such phrases, it expresses
   determination in the speaker, and implies an authority to enforce the
   act. "Do you refuse to go? Does he refuse to go? But you or he shall
   go."

   3. Shall I go, shall he go, interrogatively, asks, for permission or
   direction. But shall you go, asks for information of another's
   intention.

   4. But after another verb, shall, in the third person, simply
   foretells. He says that he shall leave town to-morrow. So also in the
   second person; you say that you shall ride to-morrow.

   5. After if, and some verbs which expresscondition or supposition,
   shall, in all the persons, simply foretells; as,

   If I shall say, or we shall say,

   Thou shalt say, ye or you shall say,

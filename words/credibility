[1]credibility

   CREDIBILITY, n. [L.] Credibleness; the quality or state of a thing
   which renders it possible to be believed, or which admits belief, on
   rational principles; the quality or state of a thing which involves no
   contradiction, or absurdity. Credibility is less than certainty, and
   greater than possibility; indeed it is less than probability, but is
   nearly allied to it. [See Credible.]

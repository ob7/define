   LUNETTE, n.

   1. In fortification, an enveloped counterguard, or elevation of earth
   made beyond the second ditch, opposite to the places of arms; or a
   covered place before the courtine, consisting of two faces that form an
   angle inward. It is commonly raised in ditches full of water, to serve
   instead of fausse brays, to dispute the enemy's passage of the ditch.

   2. In the manege, a half horse-shoe, which wants the spunge, or that
   part of the branch which runs towards the quarters of the foot.

   3. A piece of felt to cover the eye of a vicious horse.

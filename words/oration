[1]oration

   ORA'TION, n. [L. oratio, from oro, to pray, to utter.]

   1. A speech or discourse composed according to the rules of oratory,
   and spoken in public. Orations may be reduced to three kinds;
   demonstrative, deliberative, and judicial.

   2. In modern usage, an oration differs from a sermon, from an argument
   at the bar, and from a speech before a deliberative assembly. The word
   is now applied chiefly to discourses pronounced on special occasions,
   as a funeral oration, an oration on some anniversary, &c. and to
   academic declamations.

   3. A harangue; a public speech or address.

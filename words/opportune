[1]opportune

   OPPORTU'NE, a. [L. opportunus; ob and porto, to bear or bring; probably
   from the root of fero or porto, to bear. The sense of the verb opporto,
   would be to bring to or upon. See Impart, Importune. In this and all
   words of like signification, the primary sense is to fall, come or
   bring to. See Luck, Fortune, Season.]

   Properly, having come or being present at a proper time; hence,
   seasonable; timely; well timed. It agrees with seasonable rather than
   with convenient, though the sense of the latter may be included in it.

   Perhaps in view of those bright confines, whence with neighboring arms,
   and opportune excursion, we may chance re-enter heaven.

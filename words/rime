[1]rime

   RIME, n. [The deduction of this word from the Greek is a palpable
   error. The true orthography is rime or ryme; but as rime is hoar frost,
   and rhyme gives the true pronunciation, it may be convenient to
   continue the present orthography.

   1. In poetry, the correspondence of sounds in the terminating words or
   syllables of two verses, one of which succeeds the other immediately,
   or at no great distance.

   For rhyme with reason may dispense, and sound has right to govern
   sense.

   To constitute this correspondence in single words or in syllables, it
   is necessary that the vowel, and the final articulations or consonants,
   should be the same, or have nearly the same sound. The initial
   consonants may be different, as in find and mind, new and drew, cause
   and laws.

   2. A harmonical succession of sounds.

   The youth with songs and rhymes, some dance, and some haul the rope.

   3. Poetry; a poem.

   He knew himself to sing, and build the lofty rhyme.

   4. A word of sound to answer to another word.

   Rhyme or reason, number or sense.

   But from that time unto this season, I had neither rhyme nor reason.

[1]knowledge

   KNOWL'EDGE, n. nol'lej.

   1. A clear and certain perception of that which exists, or of truth and
   fact; the perception of the connection and agreement, or disagreement
   and repugnancy of our ideas.

   We can have no knowledge of that which does not exist. God has a
   perfect knowledge of all his works. Human knowledge is very limited,
   and is mostly gained by observation and experience.

   Ignorance is the curse of God, knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to
   heaven.

   3. Skill; as a knowledge of seamanship.

   4. Acquaintance with any fact or person. I have no knowledge of the man
   or thing.

   5. Cognizance; notice. Ruth 2.

   6. Information; power of knowing.

   7. Sexual intercourse. But it is usual to prefix carnal; as carnal
   knowledge.

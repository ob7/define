[1]geometry

   GEOM'ETRY, n. [Gr. the earth, and measure.] Originally and properly,
   the art of measuring the earth, or any distances or dimensions on it.
   But geometry now denotes the science of magnitude in general,
   comprehending the doctrine and relations of whatever is susceptible of
   augmentation and diminution; as the mensuration of lines, surfaces,
   solids, velocity, weight, &c., with their various relations.

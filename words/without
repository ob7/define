[1]without

   WITHOUT, prep.

   1. Not with; as without success.

   2. In a state of destitution or absence from.

   There is no living with thee nor without thee.

   3. In a state of destitution or absence from.

   There is no living with thee nor without thee.

   4. Beyond; not within.

   Eternity, before the world and after, is without our reach.

   5. Supposing the negation or omission of.

   Without the separation of the two monarchies, the most advantageous
   terms from the French must end in our destruction.

   6. Independent of; not by the use of. Men like to live without labor.

   Wise men will do it without a law.

   7. On the outside of; as without the gate; without doors.

   8. With exemption from. That event cannot happen without great damage
   to our interests.

   9. Unless; except.

   Without, when it precedes a sentence or member of a sentence, has been
   called a conjunction. This is a mistake. You will not enjoy health,
   without you use much exercise. In this sentence, without is a
   preposition still, but followed by a member of a sentence, instead of a
   single noun. It has no property of a connective or conjunction, and
   does not fall within the definition. You will not enjoy health, this
   fact following being removed, or not taking place; you use exercise.
   This use of without, is nearly superseded by unless and except, among
   good writers and speakers; but is common in popular discourse or
   parlance.

                                WITHOUT, adv.

   1. Not on the inside; not within.

   These were from without the growing miseries.

   2. Out of doors.

   3. Externally; not in the mind.

   Without were fightings, within were fears. 2 Corinthians 7.

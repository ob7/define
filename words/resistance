   RESIST'ANCE, n.

   1. The act of resisting; opposition. Resistance is passive, as that of
   a fixed body which interrupts the passage of a moving body; or active,
   as in the exertion of force to stop, repel or defeat progress or
   designs.

   2. The quality of not yielding to force or external impression; that
   power of a body which acts in opposition to the impulse or pressure of
   another, or which prevents the effect of another power; as the
   resistance of a ball which receives the force of another; the
   resistance of wood to a cutting instrument; the resistance of air to
   the motion of a cannon ball, or of water to the motion of a ship.

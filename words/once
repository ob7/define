[1]once

   ONCE, adv. wuns. [from one.]

   1. One time.

   Trees that bear mast are fruitful but once in two years.

   2. One time, though no more. The mind once tainted with vice is prone
   to grow worse and worse.

   3. At one former time; formerly.

   My soul had once some foolish fondness for thee, but hence 'tis gone.

   4. At the same point of time; not gradually.

   At once the winds arise, the thunders roll.

   At once, at the same time; as, they all moved at once; hence, when it
   refers to two or more, the sense is together, as one.

   This hath all its force at once, on the first impression.

   Once is used as a noun, when preceded by this or that; as this once,
   that once.

   ONCE, n. ons. A quadruped of the genus Felis, less than the panther, of
    a whitish gray color. It is found in Africa and Asia, is easily tamed
                   and is employed like a dog in hunting.

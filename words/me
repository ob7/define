[1]me

   ME, pron. pers.; the objective case of I, answering to the oblique
   cases of ego, in Latin. [L. mihi.] Follow me; give to me; go with me.
   The phrase "I followed me close," is not in use. Before think, as in
   methinks, me is properly in the dative case,and the verb is impersonal;
   the construction is, it appears to me.

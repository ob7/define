[1]hence

   HENCE, adv. hens.

   1. From this place.

   Arise, let us go hence. John 14.

   I will send thee far hence to the Gentiles. Acts.22.

   2. From this time; in the future; as a week hence; a year hence.

   3. From this cause or reason,noting a consequence, inference or
   deduction from something just before stated.

   Hence perhaps it is, that Solomon calls the fear of the Lord, the
   beginning of wisdom.

      It sometimes denotes an inference or consequence, resulting from
                           something that follows.

   Whence come wars and fightings among you?

   Come they not hence, even from your lusts--James 4.

   4. From this source or original.

   All other faces borrowed hence--

      Hence signifies from this, and from before hence is not strictly
    correct. But from hence is so well established by custom, that it may
            not be practicable to correct the use of the phrase.

      Hence is used elliptically and imperatively, for go hence; depart
                            hence; away; be gone.

   Hence, with your little ones.

       Hence, as a verb, to send off, as used by Sidney, is improper.

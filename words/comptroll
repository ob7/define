[1]comptroll

   COMPTROLL, from L., To count or compute, and a register. If this word
   were of genuine origin, both the verb and its derivative, as applied to
   a public officer, would not be sense. But there is no such legitimate
   word in English, nor in any other known language. [See Control.]

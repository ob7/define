[1]discreet

   DISCREET, a. [L., Gr. It is sometimes written discrete; the distinction
   between discreet and discrete are arbitrary, but perhaps not entirely
   useless. The literal sense is, separate, reserved, wary, hence
   discerning.]

   1. Prudent; wise in avoiding errors or evil, and in selecting the best
   means to accomplish a purpose; circumspect; cautious; wary; not rash.

   It is the discreet man, not the witty, nor the learned, nor the brave,
   who guides the conversation, and gives measures to society.

   Let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise. Genesis 41.

   1. An annual or stated sum of money or other valuable thing, paid by
   one prince or nation to another, either as an acknowledgment of
   submission, or as the price of peace and protection, or by virtue of
   some treaty. The Romans made all their conquered countries pay tribute,
   as do the Turks at this day; and in some countries the tribute is paid
   in children.

   3. Something given or contributed.

   POLIT'ICAL, a. [supra.] Pertaining to policy, or to civil government
   and its administration. Political measures or affairs are measures that
   respect the government of a nation or state. So we say, political power
   or authority; political wisdom; a political scheme; political opinions.
   A good prince is the political father of his people. The founders of a
   state and wise senators are also called political fathers.

   1. Pertaining to a nation or state, or to nations or states, as
   distinguished from civil or municipal; as in the phrase, political and
   civil rights, the former comprehending rights that belong to a nation,
   or perhaps to a citizen as an individual of a nation; and the latter
   comprehending the local rights of a corporation or any member of it.

   Speaking of the political state of Europe, we are accustomed to say of
   Sweden, she lost her liberty by the revolution.

   political character.

       arithmetical calculations on matters relating to a nation, its
   revenues, value of lands and effects, produce of lands or manufactures,

    Political economy, the administration of the revenues of a nation; or
   the management and regulation of its resources and productive property
   and labor. Political economy comprehends all the measures by which the
    property and labor of citizens are directed in the best manner to the
      success of individual industry and enterprise, and to the public
        prosperity. Political economy is now considered as a science.

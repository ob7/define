   UNTIL', prep. [un and till. See Till.]

   1. To; used of time.

   He and his sons were priests of the tribe of Dan, until the day of the
   captivity. Judges 18.

   2. To; used of objects. Obs.

   3. Preceding a sentence or clause, to; that is, to the event mentioned,
   or the time of it; as, until this hour; until this year.

   In open prospect nothing bounds our eye,

   Until the earth seems join'd unto the sky.

   5. To the degree that.

   [Note. Until is always the same part of speech in fact, and has the
   same signification. The only difference is, that it is followed
   sometimes by a single word denoting time, and in other cases by a verb
   denoting an event, or a word denoting place or degree. The sense is in
   all cases to; and till may be used as its substitute, and in modern
   usage it is most common.]

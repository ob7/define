   APPLAUSE', n. s as z. [L. applausus.]

   A shout of approbation; approbation and praise, expressed by clapping
   the hands, acclamation or huzzas; approbation expressed. in antiquity,
   applause differed from acclamation; applause was expressed by the
   hands, and acclamation by the voice. There were three species of
   applause, the bombus, a confused din made by the hands or mouth; the
   imbrices and testae, made by beating a sort of sounding vessels in the
   theaters. Persons were appointed for the purpose of applauding, and
   masters were employed to teach the art. The applauds were divided into
   choruses, and placed opposite to each other, like the choristers in a
   cathedral.

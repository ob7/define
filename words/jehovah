[1]jehovah

   JEHO'VAH, n. The Scripture name of the Supreme Being. If, as is
   supposed, this name is from the Hebrew substantive verb, the word
   denotes the Permanent Being, as the primary sense of the substantive
   verb in all languages, is to be fixed, to stand, to remain or abide.
   This is a name peculiarly appropriate to the eternal Spirit, the
   unchangeable God, who describes himself thus, I am that I am. Ex.3.

[1]whether

   WHETHER, pronoun or substitute. [L. The sense seems to be what, or
   which of two, referring either to persons or to sentences.]

   1. Which of two.

   Whether of them twain did the will of his father? Matthew 21/

   Here whether is a substitute for one of two, and signifies which; which
   of the two; but in this sense it is obsolete.

   2. Which of two alternatives, expressed by a sentence or the clause of
   a sentence, and followed by or. Resolve whether you will go or not;
   that is, you will go or not go; resolve which.

   [Note. IN the latter use, which is now most common, whether is called
   an adverb. This is a mistake. It is the same part of speech as in the
   former example. The only difference is that in the former example it
   represents or refers to a noun, and in the latter to a sentence or
   clause.]

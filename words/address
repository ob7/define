   ADDRESS', v.t. [This is supposed to be from L. dirigo.]

   1. To prepare; to make suitable dispositions for.

   Turnus addressed his men to single fight.

   2. To direct words or discourse; to apply to by words; as, to address a
   discourse to an assembly; to address the judges.

   3. To direct in writing; as a letter; or to direct and transmit; as he
   addressed a letter to the speaker. Sometimes it is used with the
   reciprocal pronoun, as, he addressed himself to the speaker, instead
   of, he addressed his discourse. The phrase is faulty; but less so than
   the following. To such I would address with this most affectionate
   petition.

   Young Turnus to the beauteous maid aldrest.

   The latter is admissible in poetry, as an elliptical phrase.

   4. To present an address, as a letter of thanks or congratulation, a
   petition, or a testimony of respect; as, the legislature addressed the
   president.

   5. To court or make suit as a lover.

   6. In commerce, to consign or entrust to the care of another, as agent
   or factor; as, the ship was addressed to a merchant in Baltimore.

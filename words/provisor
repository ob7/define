[1]provisor

   PROVI'SOR, n. In church affairs, a person appointed by the pope to a
   benefice before the death of the incumbent, and to the prejudice of the
   rightful patron. Formerly the pope usurped the right of presenting to
   church livings, and it was his practice to nominate persons to
   benefices by anticipation, or before they became vacant; the person
   thus nominated was called a provisor. In England, this practice was
   restrained by statues of Richard II. and Henry IV.

   More sharp and penal laws were devised against provisors; it being
   enacted that whoever disturbs any patron in the presentation to a
   living by virtue of any papal provision, such provisor shall pay fine
   and ransom to the king at his will, and be imprisoned till he renounces
   such provision.

   1. The purveyor, steward or treasurer of a religious house.

[1]bowlder

   BOWLDER, n. [from bowl.] A small stone of a roundish form, and of no
   determinate size, found on the sea shore and on the banks or in the
   channels of rivers, &c., worn smooth or rounded by the action of water;
   a pebble.

   The term bowlder is now used in Geology for rounded masses of any rock,
   found out of place, and apparently transported from their original bed
   by water. Bowlders of Granite,often of great size, are very common on
   the surface of the most recent formations.

   SOLEMN, a. sol'em. [L. solennis, form soleo, to be accustomed, to use,
   that is, to hold on or continue, as we have wont.]

   1. Anniversary; observed once a year with religious ceremonies. The
   worship of this image was advanced and a solemn supplication observed
   every year. [I doubt the correctness of this definition of Johnson; or
   whether solemn, in out language, ever includes the sense of
   anniversary. In the passage cited, the sense of anniversary is
   expressed by every year, and if it is included in solemn also the
   sentence is tautological. I should say the, that solemn in this passage
   of Stillingfleet, has the sense given in the second definition below.]

   2. Religiously grave; marked with pomp and sanctity; attended with
   religious rites. His holy rites and solemn feasts profan'd.

   3. Religiosly serious; piously grave; devout; marked by reverence to
   God; as solemn prayer; the solemn duties of the sanctuary.

   4. Affectiong with seriousness; impressing or adapted to impress
   seriousness, gravity or reverence; sober; serious. There reign'd a
   solemn silence over all. To 'swage with solemn touches troubled
   thoughts.

   5. Grave; serious; or affectedly grave; as a solemn face.

   6. Sacred; enjoined by religion; or attended with a serious appeal to
   God; as a solemn oath.

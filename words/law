   LAW, n. [L. lex; from the root of lay. See lay. A law is that which is
   laid, set or fixed, like statute, constitution, from L. statuo.]

   1. A rule, particularly an established or permanent rule, prescribed by
   the supreme power of a state to its subjects, for regulating their
   actions, particularly their social actions. Laws are imperative or
   mandatory, commanding what shall be done; prohibitory, restraining from
   what is to be forborn; or permissive, declaring what may be done
   without incurring a penalty. The laws which enjoin the duties of piety
   and morality, are prescribed by God and found in the Scriptures.

   Law is beneficence acting by rule.

   2. Municipal law, is a rule of civil conduct prescribed by the supreme
   power of a state, commanding what its subjects are to do, and
   prohibiting what they are to forbear; a statute.

   Municipal or civil laws are established by the decrees, edicts or
   ordinances of absolute princes, as emperors and kings, or by the formal
   acts of the legislatures of free states. Law therefore is sometimes
   equivalent to decree, edict, or ordinance.

   3. Law of nature, is a rule of conduct arising out of the natural
   relations of human beings established by the Creator, and existing
   prior to any positive precept. Thus it is a law of nature, that one man
   should not injure another, and murder and fraud would be crimes,
   independent of any prohibition from a supreme power.

   4. Laws of animal nature, the inherent principles by which the economy
   and functions of animal bodies are performed, such as respiration, the
   circulation of the blood, digestion, nutrition, various secretions, &c.

   5. Laws of vegetation, the principles by which plats are produced, and
   their growth carried on till they arrive to perfection.

   6. Physical laws, or laws of nature. The invariable tendency or
   determination of any species of matter to a particular form with
   definite properties, and the determination of a body to certain
   motions, changes, and relations, which uniformly take place in the same
   circumstances, is called a physical law. These tendencies or
   determinations, whether called laws or affections of matter, have been
   established by the Creator, and are, with a peculiar felicity of
   expression, denominated in Scripture, ordinances of heaven.

   7. Laws of nations, the rules that regulate the mutual intercourse of
   nations or states. These rules depend on natural law, or the principles
   of justice which spring from the social state; or they are founded on
   customs, compacts, treaties, leagues and agreements between independent
   communities.

   By the law of nations, we are to understand that code of public
   instruction, which defines the rights and prescribes the duties of
   nations, in their intercourse with each other.

   8. Moral law, a law which prescribes to men their religious and social
   duties, in other words, their duties to God and to each other. The
   moral law is summarily contained in the decalogue or ten commandments,
   written by the finger of God on two tables of stone, and delivered to
   Moses on mount Sinai.

                                   Ex. 20.

   9. Ecclesiastical law, a rule of action prescribed for the government
   of a church; otherwise called canon law.

   10. Written law, a law or rule of action prescribed or enacted by a
   sovereign, and promulgated and recorded in writing; a written statute,
   ordinance, edict or decree.

   11. Unwritten or common law, a rule of action which derives its
   authority from long usage, or established custom, which has been
   immemorially received and recognized by judicial tribunals. As this law
   can be traced to no positive statutes, its rules or principles are to
   be found only in the records of courts, and in the reports of judicial
   decisions.

   12. By-law, a law of a city, town or private corporation. [See By.]

   13. Mosaic law, the institutions of Moses, or the code of laws
   prescribed to the Jews, as distinguished from the gospel.

   14. Ceremonial law, the Mosaic institutions which prescribe the
   external rites and ceremonies to be observed by the Jews, as distinct
   from the moral precepts, which are of perpetual obligation.

   15. A rule of direction; a directory; as reason and natural conscience.

   These, having not the law, as a law to themselves. Rom. 2.

   16. That which governs or has a tendency to rule; that which has the
   power of controlling.

   But I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind,
   and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my
   members. Romans 7.

   17. The word of God; the doctrines and precepts of God, or his revealed
   will.

   But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law doth he
   meditate day and night. Ps. 1.

   18. The Old Testament.

   Is it not written in your law, I said, ye are gods? John 10.

   19. The institutions of Moses, as distinct from the other parts of the
   Old Testament; as the law and the prophets.

   of versification or poetry.

   of an army or military force.

   commercial intercourse of nations.

   and commercial intercourse are regulated between merchants.

   24. Judicial process; prosecution of right in courts of law.

   Tom Touchy is a fellow famous for taking the law of every body.

   Hence the phrase, to go to law, to prosecute; to seek redress in a
   legal tribunal.

   25. Jurisprudence; as in the title, Doctor of Laws.

   26. In general, law is a rule of action prescribed for the government
   of rational beings or moral agents, to which rule they are bound to
   yield obedience, in default of which they are exposed to punishment; or
   law is a settled mode or course of action or operation in irrational
   beings and in inanimate bodies.

   Civil law, criminal law. [See Civil and Criminal.]

   Laws of honor. [See Honor.]

   Law language, the language used in legal writings and forms,
   particularly the Norman dialect or Old French, which was used in
   judicial proceedings from the days of William the conqueror to the 36th
   year of Edward III.

   Wager of law, a species of trial formerly used in England, in which the
   defendant gave security that he would, on a certain day, make his law,

   that they believed in their consciences that he had sworn the truth.

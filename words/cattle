   CATTLE, n.

   1. Beasts or quadrupeds in general, serving for tillage, or other
   labor, and for food to man. In its primary sense, the word includes
   camels, horses, asses, all the varieties of domesticated horned beasts
   or the bovine genus, sheep of all kinds and goats, and perhaps swine.
   In this general sense, it is constantly used in the scriptures. See Job
   1. 3. Hence it would appear that the word properly signifies
   possessions, goods. But whether from a word originally signifying a
   beast, for in early ages beasts constituted the chief part of a mans
   property, or from a root signifying to get or possess. This word is
   restricted to domestic beasts; but in England it includes horses, which
   it ordinarily does not, in the United States, at least not in
   New-England.

   2. In the United States, cattle, in common usage, signifies only beasts
   of the bovine genus, oxen, bulls, cows and their young. In the laws
   respecting domestic beasts, horses, sheep, asses, mules and swine are
   distinguished from cattle, or neat cattle. Thus the law in Connecticut,
   requiring that all the owners of any cattle, sheep or swine, shall
   ear-mark or brand all their cattle, sheep and swine, does not extend to
   horses. Yet it is probable that a law, giving damages for a trespass
   committed by cattle breaking into an inclosure, would be adjudged to
   include horses.

   In Great Britain, beasts are distinguished into black cattle, including
   bulls, oxen, cows and their young; and small cattle, including sheep of
   all kinds and goats.

   3. In reproach, human beings are called cattle.

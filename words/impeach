   IMPE'ACH, v.t. [L. pango, pactus.]

   1. To hinder; to impede. This sense is found in our early writers.

   These ungracious practices of his sons did impeach his journey to the
   Holy Land.

   A defluxion on my throat impeached my utterance.

   [This application of the word is obsolete.]

   2. To accuse; to charge with a crime or misdemeanor; but appropriately,
   to exhibit charges of maladministration against a public officer before
   a competent tribunal, that is, to send or put on, to load. The word is
   now restricted to accusations made by authority; as, to impeach a
   judge. [See Impeachment.]

   3. To accuse; to censure; to call in question; as, to impeach one's
   motives or conduct.

   4. To call to account; to charge as answerable.

                          IMPE'ACH, n. Hinderance.

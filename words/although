[1]although

   ALTHO'UGH, altho', obs. verb, or used only in the Imperative.

   Grant all this; be it so; allow all; suppose that; admit all that; as,
   "although the fig tree shall not blossom." Hab. 3. That is, grant,
   admit or suppose what follows - "the fig tree shall not blossom." It is
   a transitive verb, and admits after it the definitive that - although
   that the fig tree shall not blossom; but this use of the verb, has been
   long obsolete. The word may be defined by notwithstanding, non
   obstante; as not opposing may be equivalent to admitting or supposing.

[1]victory

   VIC'TORY, n. [L. victoria, from vinco, victus, to conquer.]

   1. Conquest; the defeat of an enemy in battle, or of an antagonist in
   contest; a gaining of the superiority in war or combat. Victory
   supposes the power of an enemy or an antagonist to prove inferior to
   that of the victor. Victory however depends not always on superior
   skill or valor; it is often gained by the fault or mistake of the
   vanquished.

   Victory may be honorable to the arms, but shameful to the counsels of a
   nation.

   2. The advantage or superiority gained over spiritual enemies, over
   passions and appetites, or over temptations, or in any struggle or
   competition.

   Thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jesus
   Christ. 1Cor. 15.

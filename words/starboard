   STARBOARD, n. [G., the rudder or helm. I know not from what particular
   construction of a vessel the helm should give name to the right hand
   side, unless from the tillers being held by the right hand, or at the
   right side of the steersman.] The right hand side of a ship or boat,
   when a spectator stands with his face towards the head, stem or prow.

   STARBOARD, a. Pertaining to the right hand side of a ship; being or
   lying on the right side; as the starboard shrouds; star-board quarter;
   starboard tack. In seamanship, starboard, uttered by the master of a
   ship, is an order to the helmsman to put the helm to the starboard
   side.

[1]minium

   MIN'IUM, n. [L.] The red oxyd of lead, produced by calcination. Lead
   exposed to air while melting is covered with a gray dusky pellicle.
   This taken off and agitated becomes a greenish gray powder, inclining
   to yellow. This oxyd, separated by sifting from the grains of lead
   which it contains, and exposed to a more intense heat, takes a deep
   yellow color, and in this state it is called massicot. The latter,
   slowly heated, takes a beautiful red color, and is called minium.

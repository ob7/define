[1]coptic

   COPTIC, a. Pertaining to the descendants of the ancient Egyptians,
   called Copts, or cophti, as distinct from the Arabians and other
   inhabitants of modern Egypt. The name is supposed to be taken from
   Coptos, the metropolis of the Thebaid; as Egypt, is probably from that
   name; inclosed, fortified. To inclose, to bind, to fortify. Whatever
   may be the origin of Copt, the adjective Coptic now refers to the
   people called Copts, who are Christians, and to their language.

   COPTIC, n. The language of the Copts.

   AM'YRALDISM, n. In church history, the doctrine of universal grace, as
   explained by Amyraldus, or Amyrault, of France, in the seventeenth
   century. He taught that God desires the happiness of all men, and that
   none are excluded by a divine decree, but that none can obtain
   salvation without faith in Christ; that God refuses to none the power
   of believing, though he does not grant to all his assistance to improve
   this power.

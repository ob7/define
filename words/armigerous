   ARMIG'EROUS, a. [L. armiger, arma and gero.]

   Literally, bearing arms. But in present usage, armiger is a title of
   dignity next in degree to a knight. In times of chivalry, it signified
   an attendant on a knight, or other person of rank, who bore his shield
   and rendered him other military services. so in antiquity, Abimilech,
   Saul, &c. had their armor bearers. Judg. 9. 1Sam. 16. as had Hector and
   Achilles. This title, under the French princes, in England, was
   exchanged, in common usage, for esquire, L. scutum, a shield. Armiger
   is still retained with us as a title of respect, being the Latin word
   equivalent to esquire, which see.

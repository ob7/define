   HEM'ATITE, n. [Gr. from blood.] The name of two ores of iron, the red
   hematite,and the brown hematite. They are both of a fibrous structure,
   and the fibers, though sometimes nearly parallel,usually diverge, or
   even radiate from a center. They rarely occur amorphous, but almost
   always in concretions, reniform, globular, botryoidal, stalactitic, &c.
   The red hematite is a variety of the red oxyd; its streak and powder
   are always nearly blood red. The brown hematite is a variety of the
   brown oxyd or hydrate of iron; its streak and powder are always of a
   brownish yellow. The red hematite is also called blood-stone.

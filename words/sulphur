   SUL'PHUR, n. [L.] A simple combustible mineral substance, of a yellow
   color, brittle, insoluble in water, but fusible by heat. It is called
   also brimstone, that is, burn-stone, from its great combustibility. It
   burns with a blue flame and a peculiar suffocating odor. Sulphur native
   or prismatic is of two kinds, common and volcanic.

   CLASS, n.

   1. An order or rank of persons; a number of persons in society,
   supposed to have some resemblance or equality, in rank, education,
   property, talents, and the like; as in the phrase, all classes of men
   in society.

   The readers of poetry may be distinguished into three classes,
   according to their capacity of judging.

   2. A number of students in a college or school, of the same standing,
   or pursuing the same studies. In colleges, the students entering or
   becoming members the same year, and pursuing the same studies. In
   academies and schools, the pupils who learn the same lesson, and recite
   together. In some cases, students of different standings, pursuing the
   same studies and reciting together, or attending the same professor, or
   the same course of lectures.

   3. Scientific division or arrangement; a set of beings or things,
   having something in common, or ranged under a common denomination.
   Hence in zoology, animals are divided into classes; as quadrupeds,
   fowls, fishes, &c. So in botany, plants are arranged in classes.
   Classes are natural or artificial; natural, when founded on natural
   relations, or resemblances; artificial, when formed arbitrarily, for
   want of a complete knowledge of natural relations.

                                 CLASS, v.t.

   1. To arrange in a class or classes; to arrange in sets, or ranks,
   according to some method founded on natural distinctions; to place
   together, or in one division, men or things which have or are supposed
   to have something in common.

   2. To place in ranks or divisions students that are pursuing the same
   studies; to form into a class or classes.

   LUNG, n.

   1. The lungs are the organs of respiration in man and many other
   animals. There are two of these organs, each of which occupies its
   cavity in the thorax. They alternately inhale and expel the air, by
   means of which the necessary function of respiration is carried on.

   Each lung fills completely the cavity in which it is placed.

   2. Formerly, a person having a strong voice, and a sort of servant.

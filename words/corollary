[1]corollary

   COROLLARY, n. [L., coronet, a crown.

   1. A conclusion or consequence drawn from premises, or from what is
   advanced or demonstrated. If it is demonstrated that a triangle which
   has equal sides, has also equal angles, it follows as a corollary that
   a triangle which has three equal sides, has its three angles equal.

   A corollary is an inference from a preceding proposition.

   2. A surplus.

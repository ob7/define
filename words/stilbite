[1]stilbite

   STILBITE, n. [Gr., to shine.] A mineral of a shining pearly luster, of
   a white color, or white shaded with gray, yellow or red. It has been
   associated with zeolite, and called foliated zeolite, and radiated
   zeolite. Werner and the French mineralogists divide zeolite into two
   kinds, mesotype and stilbite; the latter is distinguished by its
   lamellar structure.

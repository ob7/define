   animals are ampibious, most of the inhabiting the sea coasts,
   particularly in the higher latitudes. They have six cutting teeth in
   the upper jaw, and four in the lower. Their hind feet are placed at the
   extremity of the body, in the same diretion with it, and serve the
   purpose of a caudal fin; the fore feet are also adapted for swimming,
   and furmished each with five claws; the external ears are either very
   small or wanting. There are numerous species; as the leonina, sometimes
   18 feet in length, and the jubata, sometimes 25 feet in length, with a
   name like a lion, both called sea-lion, and found in the southern seas,
   and alo in the N. Pacific; the ursina, or sea bear, 8 or 9 feet in
   length, and covered with long, thick bristly hair, found in the N.
   Pacifac; and the common seal frome 4 to 6 feet in length, found
   generally throughout the Atlantic and the seas and bays communicating
   with it, covered with short, stiff, glossy hair, with a smooth head
   without external ears, and with the fore legs deeply immersed in the
   skin. Seals are much sought after for their skins and fur.

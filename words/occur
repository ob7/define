   OCCUR', v.i. [L. occurro; ob and curro, to run.]

   1. Primarily, to meet; to strike against; to clash; and so used by
   Bentley, but this application is obsolete.

   2. To meet or come to the mind; to be presented to the mind,
   imagination or memory. We say, no better plan occurs to me or to my
   mind; it does not occur to my recollection; the thought did not occur
   to me.

   There doth not occur to me any use of this experiment for profit.

   3. To appear; to meet the eye; to be found here and there. This word
   occurs in twenty places in the Scriptures; the other word does not
   occur in a single place; it does not occur in the sense suggested.

   4. To oppose; to obviate. [Not used.]

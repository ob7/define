[1]amuse

   AMU'SE, v.t. s as z. [Gr. and L. musso.]

   1. To entertain the mind agreeably; to occupy or detain attention with
   agreeable objects, whether by singing, conversation, or a show of
   curiosities. Dr.Johnson remarks, that amuse implies something less
   lively than divert, and less important than please. Hence it is often
   said, we are amused with trifles.

   2. To detain; to engage the attention by hope or expectation; as, to
   amuse one by flattering promises.

[1]elaolite

   ELA'OLITE, n. [Gr. olive.] A mineral, called also fettstein
   [fat-stone.] from its greasy appearance. It has a crystalline
   structure, more or less distinctly foliated in directions parallel to
   the sides of a rhombic prism, and also in the direction of the shorter
   diagonals of the bases. Its fracture is uneven, and sometimes
   imperfectly conchoidal. Some varieties are slightly chatoyant. It is
   fusible by the blow-pipe into a white enamel. Its colors are greenish
   or bluish gray, greenish blue and flesh red, and it is more or less
   translucent.

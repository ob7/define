[1]alum

   AL'UM, n. [L. alumen.]

   A triple sulphate of alumina and potassa. This substance is white,
   transparent and very astringent; but seldom found pure or crystallized.
   This salt is usually prepared by roasting and lixiviating certain clays
   containing pyrites, and to the lye adding a certain quantity of
   potassa; the salt is then obtained by crystallization. Alum is of great
   use in medicine and the arts. In medicine, it is used as an astringent;
   internally, in hemoptoe, diarrhea, and dysentery; externally, as a
   styptic applied to bleeding vessels, and as an escharotic. In the arts,
   it is used in dyeing to fix colors; in making candles, for hardening
   the tallow; in tanning, for restoring the cohesion of skins.

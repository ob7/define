   SCEP'TIC, n. [Gr. from to look about, to consider, to speculate. See
   Show.]

   1. One who doubts the truth and reality of any principle or system of
   principles or doctrines. In philosophy, a Pyrrhonist or follower of
   Pyrrho, the founder of a sect of sceptical philosophers, who maintained
   that no certain inferences can be drawn from the reports of the senses,
   and who therefore doubted of every thing.

   2. In theology, a person who doubts the existence and perfections of
   God, or the truth of revelation; one who disbelieves the divine
   original of the christian religion.

   Suffer not your faith to be shaken by the sophistries of sceptics.

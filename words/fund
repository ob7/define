   FUND, n. [L. fundus, ground bottom, foundation; connected with L.
   fundo, to found, the sense of which is to throw down, to set, to lay.
   Heb. to build. L. funda, a sling, a casting net or purse.]

   1. A stock or capital; a sum of money appropriated as the foundation of
   some commercial or other operation, undertaken with a view to profit,
   and by means of which expenses and credit are supported. Thus the
   capital stock of a banking institution is called its fund; the joint
   stock of a commercial or manufacturing house constitutes its fund or
   funds; and hence the word is applied to the money which an individual
   may possess, or the means he can employ for carrying on any enterprise
   or operation. No prudent man undertakes an expensive business without
   funds.

   2. Money lent to government, constituting a national debt; or the stock
   of a national debt. Thus we say, a man is interested in the funds or
   public funds, when he owns the stock or the evidences of the public
   debt; and the funds are said to rise or fall, when a given amount of
   that debt sells for more or less in the market.

   3. Money or income destined to the payment of the interest of a debt.

   4. A sinking fund is a sum of money appropriated to the purchase of the
   public stocks or the payment of the public debt.

   5. A stock or capital to afford supplies of any kind; as a fund of
   wisdom or good sense; a fund of wit. Hence.

   6. Abundance; ample stock or store.

                                 FUND, v.t.

   1. To provide and appropriate a fund or permanent revenue for the
   payment of the interest of; to make permanent provision of resources
   for discharging the annual interest of; as, to fund exchequer bills or
   government notes; to fund a national debt.

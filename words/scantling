[1]scantling

   SCANT'LING, n.

   1. A pattern; a quantity cut for a particular purpose.

   2. A small quantity; as a scantling of wit.

   3. A certain proportion or quantity.

   4. In the United States, timber sawed or cut into pieces of a small
   size, as for studs, rails, &c. This seems to be allied to the L.
   scandula, and it is the sense in which I have ever heard it used in
   this country.

   5. In seamen's language, the dimensions of a piece of timber, with
   regard to its breadth and thickness.

             SCANT'LING, a. Not plentiful; small. [Not in use.]

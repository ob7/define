[1]wealthy

   WEALTHY, a. Rich; having large possessions in lands, goods, money or
   securities, or larger than the generality of men; opulent; affluent. As
   wealth is a comparative thing, a man may be wealthy in one place, and
   not so in another. A man may be deemed wealthy in a village, who would
   not be so considered in London.

   INCIS'ION, n. s as z. [L. incisio, from incido, to cut.]

   1. A cutting; the act of cutting into a substance.

   2. A cut; a gash; the separation of the surface of any substance made
   by a sharp instrument. The surgeon with his knife makes an incision in
   the flesh, and the gardener, in a tree; but we do not say, an incision
   is made with a plow or a spade; at least such phraseology is unusual.

   3. Separation of viscid matter by medicines.

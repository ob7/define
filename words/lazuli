[1]lazuli

   LAZ'ULI. Lapis Lazuli is a mineral of a fine, azure blue color, usually
   amorphous, or in rounded masses of a moderate size. It is often marked
   by yellow spots or veins of sulphuret of iron, and is much valued for
   ornamental work. It is distinguished from lazulite, by the intenseness
   of its color.

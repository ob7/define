[1]storax

   STORAX, n. [L.] A plant or tree; also, a resinous and odoriferous drug
   brought from Turkey, but generally adulterated. It imparts to water a
   yellow color, and has been deemed a resolvent.

   Storax is a solid balsam, either in red tears, or in large cakes,
   brittle, but soft to the touch, and of a reddish brown color. It is
   obtained from the Styrax officinalis, a tree which grows in the Levant.
   Liquid storax, or styrax, is a liquid or semifluid balsam, said to be
   obtained from the Liquidamber styraciflua, a tree which grows in
   Virginia. It is greenish, of an aromatic taste, and agreeable smell.

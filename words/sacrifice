   SAC'RIFICE, v.t. sac'rifize. [L. sacrifico; sacer, sacred, and facio,
   to make.]

   1. To offer to God in homage or worship, by killing and consuming, as
   victims on an altar; to immolate, either as an atonement for sin, or to
   procure favor, or to express thankfulness; as, to sacrifice an ox or a
   lamb. 2Sam. 6.

   2. To destroy, surrender or suffer to be lost for the sake of obtaining
   something; as, to sacrifice the peace of the church to a little vain
   curiosity. We should never sacrifice health to pleasure, nor integrity
   to fame.

   3. To devote with loss.

   Condemn'd to sacrifice his childish years to babbling ignorance and to
   empty fears.

   4. To destroy; to kill.

   SAC'RIFICE, v.i. To make offerings to God by the slaughter and burning
                 of victims, or of some part of them. Ex. 3.

                      SAC'RIFICE, n. [L. sacrificium.]

   1. An offering made to God by killing and burning some animal upon an
   altar, as an acknowledgment of his power and providence, or to make
   atonement for sin, appease his wrath or conciliate his favor, or to
   express thankfulness for his benefits. Sacrifices have been common to
   most nations, and have been offered to false gods, as well as by the
   Israelites to Jehovah. A sacrifice differs from an oblation; the latter
   being an offering of a thing entire or without change, as tithes or
   first fruits; whereas sacrifice implies a destruction or killing, as of
   a beast. Sacrifices are expiatory, impetratory, and eucharistical; that
   is, atoning for sin, seeking favor, or expressing thanks.

   Human sacrifices, the killing and offering of human beings to deities,
   have been practiced by some barbarous nations.

   2. The thing offered to God, or immolated by an act of religion.

   My life if thou preserv'st, my life thy sacrifice shall be.

   3. Destruction, surrender or loss made or incurred for gaining some
   object, or for obliging another; as the sacrifice of interest to
   pleasure, or of pleasure to interest.

   4. Any thing destroyed.

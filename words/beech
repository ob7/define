   BEECH, n. [Gr. payos; L. fagus.] A tree arranged by Linne under the
   genus fagus, with the chestnut. The beech grows to a large size, with
   branches forming a beautiful head, with thick foliage. The bark is
   smooth and of a silvery cast. The mast or nuts are the food of swine,
   and of certain wild animals, and yield a good oil for lamps. When eaten
   by man, they are said to occasion giddiness and headache.

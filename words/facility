   FACIL'ITY, n. [L. facilitas, from facilis, easy.]

   1. Easiness to be performed; freedom from difficulty; ease. He
   performed the work or operation with great facility.

   Though facility and hope of success might invite some other choice.

   2. Ease of performance; readiness proceeding from skill or use;
   dexterity. Practice gives a wonderful facility in executing works of
   art.

   3. Pliancy; ductility; easiness to be persuaded; readiness of
   compliance, usually in a bad sense, implying a disposition to yield to
   solicitations to evil.

   It is a great error to take facility for good nature: tenderness
   without discretion, is no better than a more pardonable folly.

   4. Easiness of access; complaisance; condescension; affability.

   He offers himself to the visits of a friend with facility.

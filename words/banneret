[1]banneret

   BAN'NERET, n. A knight made in the field. Bannerets formerly
   constituted an order of knights or feudal lords, who led their vassals
   to battle under their own flags. On the day of battle, the candidates
   presented their flags to the king or general, who cut off the train or
   skirt, and made it square. They were then called knights of the square
   flag. They were a middle order between barons and simple knights.

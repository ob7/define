   STRAIGHT, a. [L., formed from the root of reach, stretch, right. It is
   customary to write straight, for direct or right, and strait, for
   narrow, but this is a practice wholly arbitrary, both being the same
   word. Strait we use in the sense in which it is used in the south of
   Europe. Both sense proceed from stretching, straining.]

   1. Right, in a mathematical sense; direct; passing from one point to
   another by the nearest course; not deviating or crooked; as a straight
   line; a straight course; a straight piece of timber.

   2. Narrow; close; tight; as a straight garment. [See strait, as it is
   generally written.]

   3. Upright; according with justice and rectitude; not deviating from
   truth or fairness.

         STRAIGHT, adv. Immediately; directly; in the shortest time.

   I know thy generous temper well; fling but the appearance of dishonor
   on it, it straight takes fire, and mounts into a blaze.

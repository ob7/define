   MECHAN'ICAL, a. [L. mechanicus; Gr. a machine.]

   1. Pertaining to machines, or to the art of constructing machines;
   pertaining to the art of making wares, goods, instruments, furniture,
   &c. We say, a man is employed in mechanical labor; he lives by
   mechanical occupation.

   2. Constructed or performed by the rules or laws of mechanics. The work
   is not mechanical.

   3. Skilled in the art of making machines; bred to manual labor.

   4. Pertaining to artisans or mechanics; vulgar.

   To make a god, a hero or a king,

   Descend to a mechanic dialect.

   5. Pertaining to the principles of mechanics, in philosophy;

           as mechanical powers or forces; a mechanical principle.

   6. Acting by physical power; as mechanical pressure.

      The terms mechanical and chimical, are thus distinguished; those
   changes which bodies undergo without altering their constitution, that
   is, losing their identity, such as changes of place, of figure, &c. are
    mechanical; those which alter the constitution of bodies,making them
     different substances, as when flour, yeast and water unite to form
    bread, are chimical. In the one case, the changes relate to masses of
     matter, as the motions of the heavenly bodies, or the action of the
   wind on a ship under sail; in the other case, the changes occur between
   the particles of matter, as the action of heat in melting lead, or the
   union of sand and lime forming mortar. Most of what are usually called
       the mechanic arts, are partly mechanical, and partly chimical.

[1]boat-bill

   BOAT-BILL, n. [boat and bill.] A genus of birds, the Cancroma, of two
   species, the crested and the brown; but by some ornithologists, they
   are considered as varieties of the same species. They are of the
   grallic order, with a bill four inches long, not unlike a boat with the
   keel uppermost, or like the bowls of two spoons, with the hollow parts
   placed together.

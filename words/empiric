   EM'PIRIC, n. [Gr. to attempt; L. empiricus.]

   Literally, one who makes experiments. Hence its appropriate
   signification is, a physician who enters on practice without a regular
   professional education, and relies on the success of his own
   experience. Hence,the word is used also for a quack, an ignorant
   pretender to medical skill, a charlatan.

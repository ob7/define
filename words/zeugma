[1]zeugma

   ZEUGMA, n. [Gr., to join. See Yoke.] A figure in grammar by which an
   adjective or verb which agrees with a nearer word, is by way of
   supplement, referred to another more remote. Thus in Virgil, Hicillius
   arma, hic currus fuit; where fuit, which agrees directly with currus,
   is referred also to arma.

[1]captive

   CAPTIVE, n.

   1. A prisoner taken by force or stratagem in war, by an enemy; followed
   by to; as a captive to the victor.

   2. One who is charmed or subdued by beauty or excellence; one whose
   affections are seized, or who is held by strong ties of love.

   3. One who is ensnared by love or flattery, or by wiles. 2 Tim. 2:26.

   4. A slave. Anciently captives were enslaved by their conquerors. But
   in modern times, they are not made slaves in Christian countries; and
   the word captive, in a literal sense, rarely signifies a slave.

          CAPTIVE, v.t. To take prisoner; to bring into subjection.

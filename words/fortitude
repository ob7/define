[1]fortitude

   FOR'TITUDE, n. [L. fortitudo, from fortis, strong.]

   That strength or firmness of mind or soul which enables a person to
   encounter danger with coolness and courage, or to bear pain or
   adversity without murmuring, depression or despondency. Fortitude is
   the basis or source of genuine courage or intrepidity in danger, of
   patience in suffering, of forbearance under injuries, and of
   magnanimity in all conditions of life. We sometimes confound the effect
   with the cause, and use fortitude as synonymous with courage or
   patience; but courage is an active virtue or vice, and patience is the
   effect of fortitude.

   Fortitude is the guard and support of the other virtues.

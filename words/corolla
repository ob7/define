[1]corolla

   COROL, COROLLA, n. [L., a little crown.] In botany, the inner covering
   of a flower. The corol surrounds the parts of fructification, and is
   composed of one or more flower leaves, called petals. It is
   distinguished from the perianth, by the fineness of its texture and the
   gayness of its colors; but there are many exceptions. It is sometimes
   inaccurately called blossom and flower.

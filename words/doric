   the Dorians, in Greece, who dwelt near Parnassus.

   and Ionic. The Doric order is distinguished for simplicity and
   strength. It is used in the gates of cities and citadels, on the
   outside of churches, &c.

   The Doric dialect of the Greek language was the dialect of the Dorians,
   and little different from that of Lacedemon.

   ancients. Its character is to be severe, tempered with gravity and joy.

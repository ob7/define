   heat of the sun dissipates vapor; mirth dissipates care and anxiety;
   the cares of life tend to dissipate serious reflections. Scatter,

   say, an army is scattered or dispersed, but not dissipated. Trees are
   scattered or dispersed over a field, but not dissipated.

   extravagance; to waste; to consume; as, a man has dissipated his
   fortune in the pursuit of pleasure.

   3. To scatter the attention.

     DISSIPATE, v.i. To scatter; to disperse; to separate into parts and
                    disappear; to waste away; to vanish.

   A fog or cloud gradually dissipates, before the rays or heat of the
   sun. The heat of a body dissipates; the fluids dissipate.

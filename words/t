[1]t

   T is the twentieth letter of the English Alphabet, and a close
   consonant. It represents a close joining of the end of the tongue to
   the root of the upper teeth, as may be perceived by the syllables at,
   et, ot, ut, in attempting to pronounce which, the voice is completely
   intercepted. It is therefore numbered among the mutes, or close
   articulations, and it differs from d chiefly in its closeness; for in
   pronouncing ad, ed, we perceive the voice is not so suddenly and
   entirely intercepted, as in pronouncing at and et. T by itself has one
   sound only, as in take, turn, bat, bolt, smite, bitter. So we are
   accustomed to speak; but in reality, t can be hardly said to have any
   sound at all. Its use, like that of all mute articulations, is to
   modify the manner of uttering the vocal sound which precedes or follows
   it.

   When t is followed by h, as in think and that, the combination really
   forms a distinct sound for which we have no single character. This
   combination has two sounds in English; aspirated, as in think, and
   vocal, as in that.

   The letters ti, before a vowel, and unaccented, usually pass into the
   sound of sh, as in nation, motion, partial substantiate; which are
   pronounced nashon, moshon, parshal, substanshate. In the case, t loses
   entirely its proper sound or use, and being blended with the subsequent
   letter, a new sound results from the combination, which is in fact a
   simple sound. In a few words, the combination ti has the sound of the
   English ch, as in Christian, mixtion, question.

   T, as an abbreviation, stands for theologia; as, S.T.D. sanctoe
   theologioe doctor, doctor of divinity. In ancient monuments and
   writings, T is an abbreviature, which stands for Titus, Titius or
   Tullius. As a numeral, T, among the Latins, stood for 160, and with a
   dash over the top, T, for 160,000.

   In music, T is the initial of tenor, vocal and instrumental; of tacet,
   for silence, as adagio tacet, when a person is to rest during the whole
   movement. In concertos and symphonies, it is the initial of tutti, the
   whole band, after a solo. It sometimes stands for tr. or trillo, a
   shake.

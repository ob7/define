   MES'OTYPE, n. [Gr. middle, and form, type.] Prismatic zeolite; a
   mineral divided into three subspecies, fibrous zeolite, natrolite,and
   mealy zeolite. This is said by some writers to be so named from its
   property,when transparent, of doubling images. Others say it is a mean
   form between stilbite and analcime.

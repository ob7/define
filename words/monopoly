[1]monopoly

   MONOP'OLY, n. [L.monopolium.] The sole power of vending any species of
   goods, obtained either by engrossing the articles in market by
   purchase, or by a license from the government confirming this
   privilege. Thus the East India Company in Great Britain has a monopoly
   of the trade to the East Indies, granted to them by charter. Monopolies
   by individuals obtained by engrossing, are an offense prohibited by
   law. But a man has by natural right the exclusive power of vending his
   own produce or manufactures,and to retain that exclusive right is not a
   monopoly within the meaning of law.

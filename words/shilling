[1]shilling

   SHIL'LING, n. An English silver coin equal to twelve pence, or the
   twentieth part of a pound. The English shilling, or shilling sterling,
   is equivilent to nearly 22 cents, 22 hundredths, money of the United
   States. Our ancestors introduced the name with the coin into this
   country, but by depreciation the value of the shilling shrunk in New
   England and Virginia one fourth, or to a fraction less than 17 cents,
   in New York to 12 1/2 cents, in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland
   to about 11 cents.

   This denomination of money still subsists in the United States,
   although there is no coin of that value current, except the Spanish
   coin of 12 1/2/ cents, which is a shilling in the money in the state of
   New York. Since the adoption of the present coins of the United States,
   eagles, dollars, cents, &c. the use of the shilling is continued only
   by habit.

   Grow, signifies properly to shoot out, to enlarge; but it is often used
     to denote a passing from one state to another, and from greater to
                                    less.

   Marriages grow less frequent.

   [To grow less, is an abuse of this word; the phrase should be to become
   less.]

   GROW, v.t. To produce; to raise; as, a farmer grows large quantities of

    Britain, and the British use begins to be imitated in America. Until
    within a few years, we never heard grow used as a transitive verb in
             New England, and the ear revolts at the practice.]

[1]numerator

   NU'MERATOR, n. [L.]

   1. One that numbers.

   2. In arithmetic, the number in vulgar fractions which shows how many
   parts of a unit are taken. Thus when a unit is divided into 9 parts,
   and we take 5, we express it thus, 5/9, that is, five ninths; 5 being
   the numerator, and 9 the denominator.

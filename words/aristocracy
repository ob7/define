[1]aristocracy

   ARISTO'CRACY, n. [Gr. best, and to hold or govern.]

   A form of government, in which the whole supreme power is vested in the
   principal persons of a state; or in a few men distinguished by their
   rank and opulence. When the supreme power is exercised by a small
   number, the government is called an oligarchy. The latter word however
   is usually applied to a corrupted form of aristocracy.

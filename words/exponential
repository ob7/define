   EXPONEN'TIAL, a. Exponential curves are such as partake both of the
   nature of algebraic and transcendental ones. They partake of the
   former, because they consist of a finite number of terms, though these
   terms themselves are indeterminate; and they are in some measure
   transcendental, because they cannot be algebraically constructed.

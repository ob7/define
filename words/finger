[1]finger

   FIN'GER, n. fing'ger.

   1. One of the extreme parts of the hand, a small member shooting to a
   point. The fingers have joints which peculiarly fit them to be the
   instruments of catching, seizing and holding. When we speak of the
   fingers generally, we include the thumb; as the five fingers. But we
   often make a distinction. The fingers and thumb consist of fifteen
   bones; three to each. The word is applied to some other animals as well
   as to man.

   2. A certain measure. We say a finger's breadth, or the breadth of the
   four fingers, or of three fingers.

   3. The hand.

   Who teacheth my fingers to fight. Ps. 146.

   4. The finger or fingers of God, in scripture, signify his power,
   strength or operation.

   5. In music, ability; skill in playing on a keyed instrument. She has a
   good finger.

                                FIN'GER, v.t.

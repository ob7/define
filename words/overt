[1]overt

   O'VERT, a. [L. aperio.]

   Open to view; public; apparent; as overt virtues; an overt essay. But
   the word is now used chiefly in law. Thus an overt act of treason is
   distinguished from secret design or intention not carried into effect,
   and even from words spoken. A market overt, is a place where goods are
   publicly exposed to sale. A pound over, is one open overhead, as
   distinguished from a pound covert or close.

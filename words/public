[1]public

   PUB'LIC, a. [L.publicus, from the root of populus, people; that is,
   people-like.]

   1. Pertaining to a nation, state or community; extending to a whole
   people; as a public law, which binds the people of a nation or state,
   as opposed to a private statute or resolve, which respects an
   individual or a corporation only. Thus we say, public welfare, public
   good, public calamity, public service, public property.

   2. Common to many; current or circulated among people of all classes;
   general; as public report; public scandal.

   3. Open; notorious; exposed to all persons without restriction.

   Joseph her husband being a just man, and not willing to make her a
   public example, was minded to put her away privily. Matt.1.

   4. Regarding the community; directed to the interest of a nation, state
   or community; as public spirit; public mindedness; opposed to private
   or selfish.

   5. Open for general entertainment; as a public house.

   6. Open to common use; as a public road.

   7. In general, public expresses something common to mankind at large,
   to a nation, state, city or town, and is opposed to private, which
   denotes what belongs to an individual, to a family, to a company or
   corporation.

          Public law, is often synonymous with the law of nations.

      PUB'LIC, n. The general body of mankind or of a nation, state or
                    community; the people, indefinitely.

   The public is more disposed to censure than to praise.

    In this passage, public is followed by a verb in the singular number;
      but being a noun of multitude, it is more generally followed by a
                        plural verb; the public are.

   In public, in open view; before the people at large; not in private or
                                  secrecy.

   In private grieve, but with a careless scorn,

   In public seem to triumph, not to mourn.

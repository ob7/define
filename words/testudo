   TESTU'DO, n. [L.] A tortoise. Among the Romans, a cover or screen which
   a body of troops formed with their shields or targets, by holding them
   over their heads when standing close to each other. This cover
   resembled the back of a tortoise, and served to shelter the men from
   darts, stones, and other missiles. A similar defense was sometimes
   formed of boards and moved on wheels.

   1. In medicine, a broad soft tumor between the skull and the skin,
   called also talpa or mole, as resembling the subterraneous windings of
   the tortoise or mole.

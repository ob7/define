   OTH'ER, a. [Heb.]

   1. Not the same; different; not this or these.

   Then the other company which is left shall escape. Gen. 32.

   Behold, it was turned again as his other flesh. Ex. 4.

   Other lords besides thee have had dominion over us. Is. 26.

   There is one God, and there is none other but he. Mark 12.

   2. Not this, but the contrary; as, on this side of the river stands
   Troy, on the other side stands Albany.

   Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other
   also. Matt. 5.

   3. Noting something besides. To the knowledge of the Latin and Greek,
   join as much other learning as you can.

   4. Correlative to each, and applicable to any number of individuals.

   They asked each other of their welfare. Ex. 18.

   5. Opposed to some; as,"some fell among thorns - but other fell into
   good ground." Matt. 13.

   6. The next.

   7. The third part.

   Other is used as a substitute for a noun, and in this use has the
   plural number, and the sign of the possessive case.

   - The fool and the brutish person die, and leave their wealth to
   others. Ps. 49.

   What do ye more than others? Matt. 5.

   We were children of wrath even as others. Eph. 2.

   The confusion arises, when the one will put their sickle into the
   other's harvest.

   With the sign of the possessive, other is preceded by the, as in the
   last example.

   Other is sometimes put elliptically for other thing. From such a man,
   we can expect no other.

   The other day, at a certain time past, not distant but indefinite; not
   long ago.

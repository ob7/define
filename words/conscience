   CONSCIENCE, n. [L., to know, to be privy to.]

   1. Internal or self-knowledge, or judgment of right and wrong; or the
   faculty, power or principle within us, which decides on the lawfulness
   or unlawfulness of our own actions and affections, and instantly
   approves or condemns them. Conscience is called by some writers the
   moral sense, and considered as an original faculty of our nature.
   Others question the propriety of considering conscience as a distinct
   faculty or principle. The consider it rather as the general principle
   of moral approbation or disapprobation, applied to ones own conduct and
   affections; alledging that our notions of right and wrong are not to be
   deduced from a single principle or faculty, but from various powers of
   the understanding and will.

   believe the story?

   4. Consciousness; knowledge of our own actions or thought.

   actions past.

   6. In ludicrous language, reason or reasonableness.

   REFU'SAL, n. s as z.

   1. The act of refusing; denial of any thing demanded, solicited or
   offered for acceptance. The first refusal is not always proof that the
   request will not be ultimately granted.

   2. The right of taking in preference to others; the choice of taking or
   refusing; option; pre-emption. We say, a man has the refusal of a farm
   or a horse, or the refusal of an employment.

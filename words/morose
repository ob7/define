   MORO'SE, a. [L. morosus. Morose then is from the root of L. moror, to
   delay, stop, hinder, whence commoror, to dwell; Eng. demur.]

   Of a sour temper; severe; sullen and austere.

   Some have deserved censure for a morose and affected taciturnity;
   others have made speeches though they had nothing to say.

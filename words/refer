   REFER', v.t. [L. refero; re and fero, to bear.]

   1. To direct, leave or deliver over to another person or tribunal for
   information or decision; as when parties to a suit refer their cause to
   another court; or the court refers a cause to individuals for
   examination and report. A person whose opinion is requested, sometimes
   refers the inquirer to another person or other source of information.

   2. To reduce as to the ultimate end.

   You profess and practice to refer all things to yourself.

   3. To reduce; to assign; as to an order, genus or class. Naturalists
   are sometimes at a loss to know to what class or genus an animal or
   plant is to be referred.

   To refer one's self, to betake; to apply. [Little used.]

                                REFER', v.i.

   the peculiar customs of the orientals.

   2. To appeal; to have recourse; to apply.

   In suits it is good to refer to some friend of trust.

   3. To allude; to have respect to by intimation without naming. I refer
   to a well known fact.

[1]where

   WHERE, adv.

   1. At which place or places.

   She visited the place where first she was so happy--

   In all places where I record my name, I will come to thee and I will
   bless thee. Exodus 20.

   2. At or in what place.

   Adam, where art thou? Genesis 3.

   3. At the place in which.

   Where I though the remnant of my age should have been cherishd by her
   child-like duty.

   4. Whither; to what place, or from what place. Where are you going?
   Where are you from? [These uses of where are common, and the first
   cannot be condemned as vulgar.]

   Any where, in any place. I sought the man, but could not find him any
   where.

   [Note. Where seems to have been originally a noun, and was so used by
   Spenser. He shall find no where safe to him. In this sense, it is
   obsolete; yet it implies place, its original signification.]

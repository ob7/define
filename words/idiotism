[1]idiotism

   ID'IOTISM, n. [Gr. a form of speech taken from the vulgar.]

   1. An idiom; a peculiarity of expression; a mode of expression peculiar
   to a language; a peculiarity in the structure of words and phrases.

   Scholars sometimes give terminations and idiotisms suitable to their
   native language, to words newly invented.

   2. Idiocy.

   But it would be well to restrain this word to its proper signification,
   and keep idiocy and idiotism distinct.

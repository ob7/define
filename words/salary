[1]salary

   SAL'ARY, n. [L. salarium; said to be from sal, salt, which was part of
   the pay of Roman soldiers.]

   The recompense or consideration stipulated to be paid to a person for
   services, usually a fixed sum to be paid by the year, as to governors,
   magistrates, settled clergymen, instructors of seminaries, or other
   officers, civil or ecclesiastical. When wages are stated or stipulated
   by the month, week or day, we do not call the compensation salary, but
   pay or wages; as in the case of military men and laborers.

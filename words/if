[1]if

   IF, v.t. It is used as the sign of a condition, or it introduces a
   conditional sentence. It is a verb, without a specified nominative. In
   like manner we use grant, admit, suppose. Regularly, if should be
   followed, as it was formerly, by the substitute or pronoun that,
   referring to the succeeding sentence or proposition. If that John shall
   arrive in season, I will send him with a message. But that is now
   omitted,and the subsequent sentence, proposition or affirmation may be
   considered as the object of the verb. Give John shall arrive;
   grant,suppose, admit that he shall arrive, I will send him with a
   message. The sense of if, or give, in this use, is grant, admit, cause
   to be, let the fact be,let the thing take place. If then is equivalent
   to grant, allow, admit. "If thou wilt, thou canst make me whole," that
   is, thou canst make me whole, give the fact, that thou wilt.

   If thou art the son of God, command that these stones be made bread.
   Matt.14.

   1. Whether or not.

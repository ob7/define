   SLOOP, n. A vessel with one mast, the main-sail of which is attached to
   a gaff above, to a boom below, and to the mast on its foremost edge. It
   differs from a cutter by having a fixed steeving bowsprit, and a
   jib-stay. Sloops are of various sizes, from the size of a boat to that
   of more than 100 tons burthen.

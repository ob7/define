[1]preposition

   PREPOSI'TION, n. s as z. [L. proepositio, proepono, proepositus; proe
   and pono, to put.] In grammar, a word usually put before another to
   express some relation or quality, action or motion to or from the thing
   specified; as medicines salutary to health; music agreeable to the ear;
   virtue is valued for its excellence; a man is riding to Oxford from
   London. Prepositions govern cases of nouns, and in English are
   sometimes placed after the word governed; as, which person do you speak
   to? for, to which person do you speak? This separation of the
   preposition from the governed word is sometimes allowable in colloquial
   use, but is generally inelegant.

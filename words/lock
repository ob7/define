   LOCK, n. [L. floccus, Eng. lock.]

   1. Lock, in its primary sense, is any thing that fastens; but we now
   appropriate the word to an instrument composed of a spring, wards, and
   a bolt of iron or steel, used to fasten doors, chests and the like. The
   bolt is moved by a key.

   2. The part of a musket or fowling-piece or other fire-arm, which
   contains the pan, trigger, &c.

   3. The barrier or works of a canal, which confine the water, consisting
   of a dam, banks or walls, with two gates or pairs of gates, which may
   be opened or shut at pleasure.

   4. A grapple in wrestling.

   5. Any inclosure.

   6. A tuft of hair; a plexus of wool, hay or other like substance; a
   flock; a ringlet of hair.

   A lock of hair will draw more than a cable rope.

   Lock of water, is the measure equal to the contents of the chamber of
   the locks by which the consumption of water on a canal is estimated.

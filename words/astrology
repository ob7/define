   ASTROL'OGY, n. [Supra.] A science which teaches to judge of the effects
   and influences of the stars, and to foretell future events, by their
   situation and different aspects. This science was formerly in great
   request, as men ignorantly supposed the heavenly bodies to have a
   ruling influence over the physical and moral world; but it is now
   universally exploded by true science and philosophy.

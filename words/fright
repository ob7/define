   FRIGHT, n. frite. [Gr. to fear, that is, to shrink or shiver.]

   Sudden and violent fear; terror; a passion excited by the sudden
   appearance of danger. It expresses more than fear, and is distinguished
   from fear and dread, by its sudden invasion and temporary existence;
   fright being usually of short duration, whereas fear and dread may be
   long continued.

                                   FRIGHT,

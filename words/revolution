   REVOLU'TION, n. [L. revolutus, revolvo.]

   1. In physics, rotation; the circular motion of a body on its axis; a
   course or motion which brings every point of the surface or periphery
   of a body back to the place at which it began to move; as the
   revolution of a wheel; the diurnal revolution of the earth.

   2. The motion of a body round any fixed point or center; as the annual
   revolution of the earth or other planet in its orbit round the center
   of the system.

   3. Motion of any thing which brings it to the same point or state; as
   the revolution of day and night or of the seasons.

   4. Continued course marked by the regular return of years; as the
   revolution of ages.

   5. Space measured by some regular return of a revolving body or of a
   state of things; as the revolution of a day.

   6. In politics, a material or entire change in the constitution of
   government. Thus the revolution in England, in 1688, was produced by
   the abdication of king James II the establishment of the house of
   Orange upon the throne, and the restoration of the constitution to its
   primitive state. So the revolutions in Poland, in the United States of
   America, and in France, consisted in a change of constitution. We shall
   rejoice to hear that the Greeks have effected a revolution.

   7. Motion backward.

   This word is used adjectively, as in the phrase, revolution principles.

   DUPLICATE, a. [L., to double; twofold; to fold. See Double.] Double;
   twofold.

   Duplicate proportion or ratio, is the proportion or ratio of squares.
   Thus in geometrical proportion, the first term to the third is said to
   be in a duplicate ratio of the first to the second, or as its square is
   to the square of the second. Thus in 2. 4. 8. 16., the ratio of 2 to 8
   is a duplicate of that of 2 to 4, or as the square of 2 is to the
   square of 4.

                                DUPLICATE, n.

   1. Another corresponding to the first; or a second thing of the same
   kind.

   2. A copy; a transcript. Thus a second letter or bill of exchange
   exactly like the first is called a duplicate.

                  DUPLICATE, v.t. [L.] To double; to fold.

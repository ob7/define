   VIR'TUAL, a. [See Virtue.]

   1. Potential; having the power of acting or of invisible efficacy
   without the material or sensible part.

   Every kind that lives, fomented by his virtual power, and warm'd.

   Neither an actual nor virtual intention of the mind, but only that
   which may be gathered from the outward acts.

   2. Being in essence or effect, not in fact; as the virtual presence of
   a man in his agent or substitute.

[1]mart

   M`ART, n. [from market.] A place of sale or traffick. It was formerly
   applied chiefly to markets and fairs in cities and towns, but it has
   now a more extensive application. We say, the United States are a
   principal mart for English goods; England and France are the marts of
   American cotton.

   1. Bargain; purchase and sale. [Not used.]

            M`ART, v.t. To buy and sell; to traffick. [Not used.]

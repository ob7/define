   AC'ME, n. Ac'my [Gr.]

   The top or highest point. It is used to denote the maturity or
   perfection of an animal. Among physicians, the crisis of a disease, or
   its utmost violence. Old medical writers divided the progress of a
   disease into four periods, the arche, or beginning, the anabasis, or
   increase, the acme or utmost violence, and the paracme, or decline. But
   acme can hardly be considered as a legitimate English word.

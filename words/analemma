   AN'ALEMMA, n. [Gr. altitude.]

   1. In geometry, a projection of the sphere on the plane of the
   meridian, orthographically made by straight lines, circles and
   ellipses, the eye being supposed at an infinite distance, and in the
   east or west points of the horizon.

   2. An instrument of wood or brass on which this kind of projection is
   drawn, with a horizon and cursor fitted to it, in which the solstitial
   colure, and all circles parallel to it, will be concentric circles; all
   circles oblique to the eye will be ellipses; and all circles whose
   planes pass through the eye, will be right lines.

[1]prophecy

   PROPH'ECY, n. [Gr. to foretell, before and to tell. This ought to be
   written prophesy.]

   1. A foretelling; prediction; a declaration of something to come. As
   God only knows future events with certainty, no being but God or some
   person informed by him, can utter a real prophecy. The prophecies
   recorded in Scripture, when fulfilled, afford most convincing evidence
   of the divine original of the Scriptures, as those who uttered the
   prophecies could not have foreknown the events predicted without
   supernatural instruction. 2 Pet.1.

   2. In Scripture, a book of prophecies; a history; as the prophecy of
   Ahijah. 2 Chron. 9.

   3. Preaching; public interpretation of Scripture; exhortation or
   instruction. Prov.31.

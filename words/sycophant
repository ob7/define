   SYC'OPHANT, n. [Gr. a fig, and to discover.] Originally, an informer
   against those who stole figs, or exported them contrary to law, &c.
   Hence in time it came to signify a talebearer or informer, in general;
   hence, a parasite; a mean flatterer; especially a flatterer of princes
   and great men; hence, a deceiver; an impostor. Its most general use is
   in the sense of an obsequious flatterer or parasite.

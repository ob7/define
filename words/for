[1]for

   FOR, prep. [L. per.; The English, for; to forbid. For corresponds in
   sense with the L. pro, as fore does with proe, but pro and proe are
   probably contracted from prod, proed. The Latin por, in composition, as
   in porrigo, is probably contracted from porro, Gr. which is the English
   far. The Gr. are from the same root. The radical sense of for is to go,
   to pass, to advance, to reach or stretch.]

   according to the original, he gave them bread against horses like the
   Gr. Gen. 48:17.

   advanced. "That ye may be the children of your father who is in heaven;

   noun, and here it precedes a sentence or clause; but the phrase seems
   to be elliptical, for this cause or reason, which follows, he maketh

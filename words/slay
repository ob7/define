[1]slay

   SLAY, v.t. pret. slew; pp. slain. [The proper sense is to strike, and
   as beating was an early mode of killing, this word, like smite, came to
   signify to kill. It seems to be formed on the root of lay; as we say to
   lay on.]

   1. To kill; to put to death by a weapon or by violence. We say, he slew
   a man with a sword, with a stone, or with a club, or with other arms;
   but we never say, the serif slays a malefactor with a halter, or a man
   is slain on the gallows or by poison. So the slay retains something of
   its primitive sense of striking or beating. It is particularly applied
   to killing in battle, but is properly applied also to the killing of a
   individual man or beast.

   2. To destroy.

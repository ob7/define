   STRENGTH, n. [See Strong.]

   1. That property or quality of an animal body by which it is enabled to
   move itself or other bodies. We say, a sick man has not strength to
   walk, or to raise his head or his arm. We say, a man has strength to
   lift a weight, or to draw it. This quality is called also power and
   force. But force is also used to denote the effect of strength exerted,
   or the quantity of motion. Strength in this sense, is positive, or the
   power of producing positive motion or action, and is opposed to
   weakness.

   2. Firmness; solidity or toughness; the quality of bodies by which they
   sustain the application of force without breaking or yielding. Thus we
   speak of the strength of a bone, the strength of a beam, the strength
   of a wall, the strength of a rope. In this sense, strength is a passive
   quality, and is opposed to weakness or frangibility.

   3. Power or vigor of any kind.

   This act shall crush the strength of Satan.

   Strength there must be either of love or war.

   4. Power of resisting attacks; fastness; as the strength of a castle or
   fort.

   5. Support; that which supports; that which supplies strength;
   security.

   God is our refuge and strength. Psalm 46.

   6. Power of mind; intellectual force; the power of any faculty; as
   strength of memory; strength of reason; strength of judgment.

   7. Spirit; animation.

   Me thinks I feel new strength within me rise.

   8. Force of writing; vigor; nervous diction. The strength of words, of
   style, of expression and the like, consists in the full and forcible
   exhibition of ideas, by which a sensible or deep impression is made on
   the mind of a hearer or reader. It is distinguished from softness or
   sweetness. Strength of language enforces an argument, produces
   conviction, or excites wonder or other strong emotion; softness and
   sweetness give pleasure.

   And praise the easy vigor of a line, where Denhams strength and Wellers
   sweetness join.

   9. Vividness; as strength of colors or coloring.

   10. Spirit; the quality of any liquor which has the power of affecting
   the taste, or of producing sensible effects on other bodies; as the
   strength of wine or spirit; the strength of an acid.

   11. The virtue or spirit of any vegetable, or of its juices or
   qualities.

   12. Legal or moral force; validity; the quality of binding, uniting or
   securing; as the strength of social or legal obligations; the strength
   of law; the strength of public opinion or custom.

   13. Vigor; natural force; as the strength of natural affection.

   14. That which supports; confidence.

   The allies, after a successful summer, are too apt upon the strength of
   it to neglect preparation for the ensuing campaign.

   15. Amount of force, military or naval; an army or navy; number of
   troops or ships well appointed. What is the strength of the enemy by
   land, or by sea?

   16. Soundness; force; the quality that convinces, persuades or commands
   assent; as the strength of an argument or of reasoning; the strength of
   evidence.

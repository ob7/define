   BLENCH, v.i. [This evidently is the blanch of Bacon [see Blanch.] and
   perhaps the modern flinch.]

   To shrink; to start back to give way.

   BLENCH, v.t. To hinder or obstruct, says Johnson. But the etymology
   explains the passage he cites in a different manner. "The rebels
   carried great trusses of hay before them, to blench the defendants'
   fight." That is, to render the combat blank; to render it ineffectual;
   to break the force of the attack; to deaden the shot.

   BLENCH, n. A start.

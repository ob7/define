[1]desire

   DESIRE, n.

   1. An emotion or excitement of the mind, directed to the attainment or
   possession of an object from which pleasure, sensual, intellectual or
   spiritual, is expected; a passion excited by the love of an object, or
   uneasiness at the want of it, and directed to its attainment or
   possession. Desire is a wish to possess some gratification or source of
   happiness which is supposed to be obtainable. A wish may exist for
   something that is or is not abtainable. Desire, when directed solely to
   sensual enjoyment, differs little from appetite. In other languages,
   desire is expressed by longing or reaching toward, and when it is
   ardent or intense, it approaches to longing, but the word in English
   usually expresses less than longing.

   We endeavored-to see your face with great desire. 1 Thess. 2.

   Thou satisfiest the desires of every living thing. Ps. 145.

   Desire is that internal act, which, by influencing the will, makes us
   proceed to action.

                                DESIRE, v.t.

   affection than longing.

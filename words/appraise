   APPRA'ISE, v.t. [L. ad and pretium, price. See Price and Appreciate.]

   This word is written and often pronounced after the French and Italian
   manner. But generally it is pronounced more correctly apprize, directly
   from the Eng. price or prize. [See Apprize.]

   To set a value; to estimate the worth, particularly by persons
   appointed for the purpose.

   CONTRADICTION, n. [L.]

   1. An assertion of the contrary to what has been said or affirmed;
   denial; contrary declaration.

   2. Opposition, whether by words, reproaches or attempts to defeat.

   Consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against
   himself. Hebrews 12.

   3. Direct opposition or repugnancy; inconsistency with itself;
   incongruity or contrariety of things, words, thoughts or propositions.
   These theorems involve a contradiction.

   If we perceive truth, we thereby perceive whatever is false in
   contradiction to it.

   ANACAMP'TIC, a. [Gr. to bend.]

   1. Reflecting or reflected; a word formerly applied to that part of
   optics, which treats of reflection; the same as what is now called
   catoptric. [See Catoptrics.]

   2. Anacamptic sounds, among the Greeks, were sounds produced by
   reflection, as in echoes; or such as proceeded downwards from acute to
   grave.

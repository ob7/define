   CREDIT, n. [L., See Creed.]

   1. Belief; faith; a reliance or resting of the mind on the truth of
   something said or done. We give credit to a mans declaration, when the
   mind rests on the truth of it, without doubt or suspicion, which is
   attended with wavering. We give credit to testimony or to a report,
   when we rely on its truth and certainty.

   2. Reputation derived from the confidence of others. Esteem;
   estimation; good opinion founded on a belief of a mans veracity,
   integrity, abilities and virtue; as a physician in high credit with his
   brethren. Hence,

   3. Honor; reputation; estimation; applied to men or things. A man gains
   no credit by profaneness; and a poem may lose no credit by criticism.
   The credit of a man depends on his virtues; the credit of his writings,
   on their worth.

   4. That which procures or is entitled to belief; testimony; authority
   derived from ones character, or from the confidence of others. We
   believe a story on the credit of the narrator. We believe a story on
   the credit of the narrator. We believe in miracles on the credit of
   inspired men. We trust to the credit of assertion, made by a man of
   known veracity.

   5. Influence derived from the reputation of veracity or integrity, or
   from the good opinion or confidence of others; interest; power derived
   from weight of character, from friendship, fidelity or other cause. A
   minister may have great credit with a prince. He may employ his credit
   to good or evil purposes. A man uses his credit with a friend; a
   servant, with his master.

   6. In commerce, trust; transfer of goods in confidence of future
   payment. When the merchant gives a credit, he sells his wares on an
   expressed or implied promise that the purchaser will pay for them at a
   future time. The seller believes in the solvability and probity of the
   purchaser, and delivers his goods on that belief or trust; or he
   delivers them on the credit or reputation of the purchaser. The
   purchaser takes what is sold, on credit. In like manner, money is
   loaned on the credit of the borrower.

   7. The capacity of being trusted; or the reputation of solvency and
   probity which entitles a man to be trusted. A customer has good credit
   or no credit with a merchant.

   8. In book-keeping, the side of an account in which payment is entered;
   opposed to debit. This article is carried to ones credit, and that to
   his debit. We speak of the credit side of an account.

   9. Public credit, the confidence which men entertain in the ability and
   disposition of a nation, to make good its engagements with its
   creditors; or the estimation in which individuals hold the public
   promises of payment, whether such promises are expressed or implied.
   The term is also applied to the general credit of individuals in a
   nation; when merchants and others are wealthy, and punctual in
   fulfilling engagements; or when they transact business with honor
   fidelity; or when transfers of property are made with ease for ready
   payment. So we speak of the credit of a bank, when general confidence
   is placed in its ability to redeem its notes; and the credit of a
   mercantile house rests on its supposed ability and probity, which
   induce men to trust to its engagements.

   Cherish public credit.

   When the public credit is questionable, it raises the premium on loans.

   10. The notes or bills which are issued by the public or by
   corporations or individuals, which circulate on the confidence of men
   in the ability and disposition in those who issue them, to redeem them.
   They are sometimes called bills of credit.

   11. The time given for payment for lands or goods sold on trust; as a
   long credit, or a short credit.

   12. A sum of money due to any person; any thing valuable standing on
   the creditor side of an account. A has a credit on the books of B. The
   credits are more than balanced by the debits.

              [In this sense, the word has the plural number.]

                        CREDIT, v.t. [from the Noun.]

   1. To believe; to confide in the truth of; as, to credit a report, or
   the man who tells it.

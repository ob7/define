   APPROACH, v.i. [The Latin proximus contains the root, but the word, in
   the positive degree, is not found in the Latin. It is from a root in
   class Brg, signifying to drive, move, or press toward.]

   1. To come or go near, in place; to draw near; to advance nearer.

   Wherefore approached ye so nigh the city? 2Sam. 11.

   2. To draw near in time.

   And so much the more as ye see the day approac. Heb. 10.

   3. To draw near, in a figurative sense; to advance near to a point
   aimed at, in science, literature, government, morals, &c.; to
   approximate; as, he approaches to the character of the ablest
   statesman.

   4. To draw near in duty, as in prayer or worship.

   They take delight in approaching to God. Isiah. 51.

                               APPROACH, v.t.

   1. To come near to; as, Pope approaches Virgil in smoothness of
   versification. This use of the word is elliptical, to being omitted, so
   that the verb can hardly be said to be transitive. The old use of the
   word, as "approach the hand to the handle," is not legitimate.

   2. To have access carnally. Lev. 18.

   3. In gardening, to ingraft a sprig or shoot of one tree into another,
   without cutting it from the parent stock.

                                 APPROACH, n

   1. The act of drawing near; a coming or advancing near; as, he was
   aprised of the enemy's approach.

   2. Access; as, the approach to kings.

   3. In fortification, not only the advances of an army are called
   approaches, but the works thrown up by the beseigers, to protect them
   in their advances towards a fortress.

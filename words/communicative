   COMMUNICATIVE, a.

   1. Inclined to communicate; ready to impart to others. In the sense of
   liberal of benefits, though legitimate, it is little used.

   2. Disposed to impart or disclose, as knowledge, opinions, or facts;
   free to communicate; not reserved.

   We have paid for our want of prudence, and determine for the future to
   be less communicative.

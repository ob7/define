[1]lest

   LEST, con. That not; for fear that.

   Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. Gen. 3.

   The phrase may be thus explained. Ye shall not touch it; that separated
   or dismissed, ye die. That here refers to the preceding command or
   sentence; that being removed or not observed, the fact being not so, ye
   will die.

   Sin no more, lest a worse thing come to thee. John 5.

   Sin no more; that fact not taking place, a worse thing will happen to
   thee.

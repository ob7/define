   VEST'ED, pp.

   1. Clothed; covered; closely encompassed.

   2. a. Fixed; not in a state of contingency or suspension; as vested
   rights.

   Vested legacy, in law, a legacy the right to which commences in
   presenti, and does not depend on a contingency, as a legacy to one, to
   be paid when he attains to twenty one years of age. This is a vested
   legacy, and if the legatee dies before the testator, his representative
   shall receive it.

   Vested remainder, is where the estate is invariably fixed, to remain to
   a determinate person, after the particular estate is spent. This is
   called a remainder executed, by which a present interest passes to the
   party, though to be enjoyed in future.

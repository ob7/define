[1]straw

   STRAW, n. [G., L. See Strew.]

   1. The stalk or stem of certain species of grain, pulse, &c. Chiefly of
   wheat, rye, oats, barley, buckwheat and peas. When used of single
   stalks, it admits of a plural, straws. Straws may show which way the
   wind blows. We say of grain while growing, the straw is large, or it is
   rusty.

   2. A mass of the stalks of certain species of grain when cut, and after
   being thrashed; as a bundle or a load of straw. In this sense, the word
   admits not the plural number.

   3. Any thing proverbially worthless. I care not a straw for the play. I
   will not abate a straw.

          STRAW, v.t. To spread or scatter. [See Strew and Strow.]

   EVAP'ORATE, v.i. [L. evaporo; e and vaporo, from vapor, which see.]

   1. To pass off in vapor, as a fluid; to escape and be dissipated,
   either in visible vapor, or in particles too minute to be visible.
   Fluids when heated often evaporate in visible steam; but water, on the
   surface of the earth, generally evaporates in an imperceptible manner.

   2. To escape or pass off without effect; to be dissipated; to be
   wasted. Arguments evaporate in words. The spirit of a writer often
   evaporates in translating.

     EVAP'ORATE, v.t. To convert or resolve a fluid into vapor, which is
     specifically lighter than the air; to dissipate in fumes, steam, or
   minute particles. Heat evaporates water at every point of temperature,
     from 32 degrees to 212 degrees, the boiling point, of Fahrenheit. A
    north west wind, in New England, evaporates water and dries the earth
            more rapidly, than the heat alone of a summer's day.

   1. To give vent to; to pour out in words or sound.

                     EVAP'ORATE, a. Dispersed in vapors.

     Balm of Gilead. A plant of the genus Amyris. Its leaves yield, when
    bruised, a strong aromatic scent; and from this plant is obtained the
    balm of Gilead of the shops, or balsam of Mecca or of Syria. It has a
    yellowish or greenish color, a warm bitterish aromatic taste, and an
    acidulous fragrant smell. It is valued as an odoriferous unguent, and
     cosmetic, by the Turks, who possess the country of its growth, and
                     hence it is adulterated for market.

[1]requisition

   REQUISI'TION, n. [See Require.]

   Demand; application made as of right. Under the old confederation of
   the American states, congress often made requisitions on the states for
   money to supply the treasury; but they had no power to enforce their
   requisitions, and the states neglected or partially complied with them.

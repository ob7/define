   P`ARCENER, n. [L. pars.] Parcener or co-parcener is a co-heir, or one
   who holds lands by descent from an ancestor in common with another or
   with others; as when land descends to a man's daughters, sisters,
   aunts, cousins, or their representatives. In this case, all the heirs
   inherit as parceners or co-heirs.

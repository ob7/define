   DEPRECATE, v.t. [L. To pray.]

   1. To pray against; to pray or intreat that a present evil may be
   removed, or an expected one averted.

   The judgments we would deprecate are not removed.

   We should all deprecate the return of war.

   2. More generally, to regret; to have or to express deep sorrow at a
   present evil, or at one that may occur. This word is seldom used to
   express actual prayer; but it expresses deep regret that an evil exists
   or may exist, which implies a strong desire that it may be removed or
   averted.

   3. To implore mercy of.

   WINDOW, n. [ G. The vulgar pronunciation is windor, as if from the
   Welsh gwyntdor, wind-door.]

   1. An opening in the wall of a building for the admission of light, and
   of air when necessary. This opening has a frame on the sides, in which
   are set movable sashes, containing panes of glass. In the United Sates,
   the sashes are made to rise and fall, for the admission or exclusion of
   air. In France, windows are shut with frames or sashes that open and
   shut vertically, like the leaves of a folding door.

   2. An aperture or opening.

   A window shalt thou make to the ark. Genesis 6.

   3. The frame or other thing that covers the aperture.

   Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes.

   4. An aperture; or rather the clouds or water-spouts.

   The windows of heaven were opened. Genesis 7.

   5. Lattice or casement; or the network of wire used before the
   invention of glass. Judges 5.

   6. Lines crossing each other.

   Till he has windows on his bread and butter.

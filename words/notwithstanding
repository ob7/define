[1]notwithstanding

   NOTWITHSTAND'ING, the participle of withstand, with not prefixed, and
   signifying not opposing; nevertheless. It retains in all cases its
   participial signification. For example, "I will surely rend the knigdom
   from thee, and will give it to thy servant; notwithstanding, in thy
   days I will not do it, for david thy father's sake." 1 Kings 11. In
   this passage there is an ellipsis of that, after notwithstanding. That
   refers to the former part of the sentence, I will rend the kingdom from
   thee; notwithstanding that (declaration or determination,) in thy days
   I will not do it. in this and in all cases, notwithstanding, either
   with or without that or this, constitutes the case absolute or
   independent.

   "It is a rainy day, but notwithstanding that, the troops must be
   reviewed; " that is, the rainy day not opposing or preventing. That, in
   this case, is a substitute for the whole first clause of the sentence.
   It is to that clause what a relative is to an antecedent noun, and
   which may be used in the place of it; notwithstanding which, that is,
   the rainy day.

   "Christ enjoined on his followers not to publish the cures he wrought;
   but notwithstanding his injunctions, they proclaimed them." Here,
   notwithstanding his injunctions, is the case independent or absolute;
   the injunctions of Christ not opposing or preventing.

   This word answers precisely to the latin non obstante, and both are
   used with nouns or with substitutes for nouns, for sentences or for
   clauses of sentences. So in the Latin phrase, hoc non obstante, hoc may
   refer to a single word, to a sentence or to a series of sentences.

[1]mountain

   MOUNT'AIN, n. [L. adjective, montanus.] A large mass of earth and rock,
   rising above the common level of the earth or adjacent land, but of no
   definite altitude. We apply mountain to the largest eminences on the
   globe; but sometimes the word is used for a large hill. In general,
   mountain denotes an elevation higher and larger than a hill; as the
   Altaic mountains in Asia, the Alps in Switzerland, the Andes in South
   America,the Allegheny mountains in Virginia, the Catskill in New York,
   the White mountains in New Hampshire, and the Green mountains in
   Vermont. The word is applied to a single elevation, or to an extended
   range.

   MOUNT'AIN, a. Pertaining to a mountain; found on mountains; growing or
   dwelling on a mountain; as mountain air; mountain pines; mountain
   goats.

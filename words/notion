[1]notion

   NO'TION, n. [L. known; to know.]

   1. Conception; mental apprehension of whatever may be known or
   imagined. We may have a just notion of power, or false notions
   respecting spirit.

   Notion and idea are primarily different; idea being the conception of
   something visible, as the idea of a square or a triangle; and notion
   the conception of things invisible or intellectual, as the notion we
   have of spirits. But from negligence in the use of idea, the two words
   are constantly confounded.

   What hath been generally agreed on, I content myself to assume under
   the notion of principles.

   Few agree in their notions about these words.

   That notion of hunger, bold, sound, color, thought, wish or fear, which
   is in the mind, is called the idea of hunger, cold, &c.

   2. sentiment; opinion; as the extravagant notions they entertain of
   themselves.

   3. Sense; understanding; intellectual power. [Not used.]

   4. Inclination; in vulgar use; as, I have a notion to do this or that.

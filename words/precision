[1]precision

   PRECI'SION, n. s as z. [L. proecisio.] Exact limitation; exactness;
   accuracy. Precision in the use of words is a prime excellence in
   discourse; it is indispensable in controversy, in legal instruments and
   in mathematical calculations. Neither perspicuity nor precision should
   be sacrificed to ornament.

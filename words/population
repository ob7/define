[1]population

   POPULA'TION, n. The act or operation of peopling or furnishing with
   inhabitants; multiplication of inhabitants. The value of our western
   lands is annually enhanced by population.

   1. The whole number of people or inhabitants in a country. The
   population of England is estimated at ten millions of souls; that of
   the United States in 1823, was ten millions.

   A country may have a great population, and yet not be populous.

   2. The state of a country with regard to its number of inhabitants, or
   rather with regard to its numbers compared with their expenses,
   consumption of goods and productions, and earnings.

   Neither is the population to be reckoned only by number; for a smaller
   number that spend more and earn less, do wear out an estate sooner than
   a greater number that live lower and gather more.

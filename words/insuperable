[1]insuperable

   INSU'PERABLE, a. [L. insuperabilis; in and superabilis, from supero, to
   overcome or surpass.]

   1. That cannot be overcome or surmounted; insurmountable; as
   insuperable difficulties, objections or obstacles.

   2. That cannot be passed over.

   And middle natures, how they long to join,

   Yet never pass th' insuperable line.

   The latter application is unusual. This word is rarely or never used in
   reference to any enemy, in the sense of invincible or unconquerable. We
     do not say that troops or enemies are insuperable; but the word is
   applied chiefly to difficulties, objections, obstacles or impediments.

[1]catachresis

   CATACHRESIS, n. An abuse of a trope or of words; a figure in rhetoric,
   when one word is abusively put for another, or when a word is too far
   wrested from its true signification; as, a voice beautiful to the ear.

   A catachresis is a trope which borrows the name of one thing to express
   another, or a harsh trope; as when Milton, speaking of Raphaels descent
   from heaven, says, he sails between worlds and worlds. Here the novelty
   of the word sails enlivens the image. So in scripture we read of the
   blood of the grape. Deut. 32.

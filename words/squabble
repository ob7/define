[1]squabble

   SQUABBLE, v.i. [I know not the origin of this word, but it seems to be
   from the root of wabble; G., to vibrate, to quake, to be sleek. See
   Squab.]

   1. To contend for superiority; to scuffle; to struggle; as, two persons
   squabble in sport.

   2. To contend; to wrangle; to quarrel.

   3. To debate peevishly; to dispute. If there must be disputes, it is
   less criminal to squabble than to murder.

   [Squabble is not an elegant word in any of its uses. In some of them it
   is low.]

        SQUABBLE, n. A scuffle; a wrangle; a brawl; a petty quarrel.

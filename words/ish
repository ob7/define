[1]ish

   ISH, a termination of English words,is, in Sax. isc. Dan.isk, G. isch;
   and not improbably, it is the termination esque, in French, as in
   grotesque, It.esco, in grotesco, and the Latin termination of the
   inceptive verb, as in fervesco. Annexed to English adjectives, ish
   denotes diminutive, or a small degree of the quality; as whitish, from
   white; yellowish, from yellow.

   ISH annexed to names forms a possessive adjective; as in Swedish,
   Danish, English.

   ISH annexed to common nouns forms an adjective denoting a participation
   of the qualities expressed by the noun; as foolish, from fool; roguish,
   from rogue; brutish, from brute. This is the more common use of this
   termination.

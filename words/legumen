[1]legumen

   LEGU'MEN, n. [L. legumen, lego to collect, and signifying that which
   collects, or holds, or a collection.]

   1. In botany, a pericarp or seed-vessel, of two valves, in which the
   seeds are fixed to one suture only. In the latter circumstance it
   differs from a siliqua, in which the seeds are attached to both
   sutures. In popular use, a legume is called a pod, or a cod; as a
   pea-pod, or peas-cod.

   2. In the plural, pulse, peas, beans, &c.

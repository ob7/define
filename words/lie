[1]lie

   LIE, water impregnated with alkaline salt, is written lye, to
   distinguish it from lie, a falsehood.

   LIE, n.

   1. A criminal falsehood; a falsehood uttered for the purpose of
   deception; an intentional violation of truth. Fiction, or a false
   statement or representation, not intended to deceive, mislead or
   injure, as in fables, parables and the like, is not a lie.

   It is willful deceit that makes a lie. A man may act a lie, as by
   pointing his finger in a wrong direction, when a traveler inquires of
   him his road.

   2. A fiction; in a ludicrous sense.

   3. False doctrine. 1John 2.

   4. An idolatrous picture of God, or a false god. Romans 1.

   5. That which deceives and disappoints confidence.

   lie to his words.

   Thou hast not lied to men, but to God. Acts 5.

   2. To exhibit a false representation; to say or do that which deceives
   another, when he has a right to know the truth, or when morality
   requires a just representation.

      LIE, v.i. pret. lay; pp. lain, [lien, obs.] [The Gr. word usually

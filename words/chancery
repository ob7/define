   CHANCERY, n.

   1. In Great Britain, the highest court of justice, next to the
   parliament, consisting of two distinct tribunals; one ordinary, being a
   court of common law; the other extraordinary, or a court of equity. The
   ordinary legal court holds pleas of recognizance acknowledged in the
   chancery, writs of scire facias, for repeal of letters patent, writs of
   partition, and all personal action by or against any officer of the
   court. But if the parties come to issue, in fact, this court cannot try
   it by a jury; but the record must be delivered to the kings bench. Rom
   this court issue all original writs that pass under the great seal,
   commissions of charitable uses, bankruptcy, idiocy, lunacy, &c.

   The extraordinary court, or court of equity, proceeds upon rules of
   equity and conscience, moderates the rigor of the common law, and gives
   relief in cases where there is no remedy in the common law courts.

   2. In the United States, a court of equity.

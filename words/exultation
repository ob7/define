[1]exultation

   EXULTA'TION, n. The act of exulting; lively joy at success or victory,
   or at any advantage gained; great gladness; rapturous delight; triumph.
   Exultation usually springs from the gratification of our desire of some
   good; particularly of distinction or superiority, or of that which
   confers distinction. It often springs from the gratification of pride
   or ambition. But exultation may be a lively joy springing from laudable
   causes.

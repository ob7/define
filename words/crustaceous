[1]crustaceous

   CRUSTACEOUS, a. [L.] Pertaining to crust; like crust; of the nature of
   crust or shell. Crustaceous animals, or Crustacea, have a crust or
   shell composed of several jointed pieces, and in their external form
   have a great resemblance to insects; but in their internal structure
   and economy, they are quite different. They were arranged by Linne, in
   the same class with the insects, but now form a class by themselves.
   They include the crab, lobster, shrimp, &c.

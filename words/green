   GREEN, a.

   1. Properly, growing, flourishing, as plants; hence, of the color of
   herbage and plants when growing, a color composed of blue and yellow
   rays, one of blue and yellow rays, one of the original prismatic
   colors; verdant.

   2. New; fresh; recent; as a green wound.

   The greenest usurpation.

   3. Fresh; flourishing; undecayed; as green old age.

   4. Containing its natural juices; not dry; not seasoned; as green wood;
   green timber.

   5. Not roasted; half raw.

   We say the meat is green, when half-roasted.

   [Rarely, if ever used in America.]

   6. Unripe; immature; not arrived to perfection; as green fruit. Hence,

   7. Immature in age; young; as green in age or judgment.

   8. Pale; sickly; wan; of a greenish pale color.

     GREEN, n. The color of growing plants; a color composed of blue and
    yellow rays, which, mixed in different proportions, exhibit a variety
          of shades; as apple green, meadow green, leek green, &c.

   1. A grassy plain or plat; a piece of ground covered with verdant
   herbage.

   O'er the smooth enameled green.

   2. Fresh leaves or branches of trees or other plants; wreaths; usually
   in the plural.

   The fragrant greens I seek, my brows to bind.

   3. The leaves and stems of young plants used in cookery or dressed for
   food in the spring; in the plural.

    GREEN, v.t. To make green. This is used by Thomson and by Barlow, but
    is not an elegant word, nor indeed hardly legitimate, in the sense in
    which these writers use it. "Spring greens the year." "God greens the
   groves." The only legitimate sense of this verb, if used, would be, to
     dye green, or to change to a green color. A plant growing in a dark
     room is yellow; let this plant be carried into the open air,and the
    rays of the sun will green it. This use would correspond with the use
                         of whiten, blacken, redden.

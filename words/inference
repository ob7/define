[1]inference

   IN'FERENCE, n. A truth or proposition drawn from another which is
   admitted or supposed to be true; a conclusion. Inferences result from
   reasoning, as when the mind perceives such a connection between ideas,
   as that, if certain propositions called premises are true, the
   conclusions or propositions deduced from them must also be true.

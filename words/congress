   CONGRESS, n. [L., to come together; to go or step; a step. See Grade
   and Degree.]

   1. A meeting of individuals; an assembly of envoys, commissioners,
   deputies, &c., particularly a meeting of the representatives of several
   courts, to concert measures for their common good, or to adjust their
   mutual concerns.

   2. The assembly of delegates of the several British Colonies in
   America, which united to resist the claims of Great Britain in 1774,
   and which declared the colonies independent.

   3. The assembly of the delegates of the several United States, after
   the declaration of Independence, and until the adoption of the present
   constitution, and the organization of the government in 1789. During
   these periods, the congress consisted of one house only.

   4. The assembly of senators and representatives of the several states
   of North America, according to the present constitution, or political
   compact, by which they are united in a federal republic; the
   legislature of the United States, consisting of two houses, a senate
   and a house of representatives. Members of the senate are elected for
   six years, but the members of the house of representatives are chosen
   for two years only. Hence the united body of senators and
   representatives for the two years , during which the representatives
   hold their seats is called one congress. Thus we say the first or
   second session of the sixteenth congress.

   5. A meeting of two or more persons in a contest; an encounter; a
   conflict.

   6. The meeting of the sexes in sexual commerce.

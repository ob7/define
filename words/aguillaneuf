[1]aguillaneuf

   AGUILLANEUF', n. [From a, to, gui, misleto, and l'an neuf, the new
   year.]

   A form of rejoicing among the ancient Franks, on the first day of the
   year; derived from the druidical custom of cutting misleto, which was
   held sacred by the druids, and on the first day of the year,
   consecrating it by crying, aguillaneuf, the year to the misleto. This
   cry is said to be still observed in some parts of France; and the term
   came to signify also a begging of New Year's gifts.

[1]animosity

   ANIMOS'ITY, n. [L. animositas; animosus, animated, courageous, enraged;
   from animus, spirit, mind passion. Gr. wind, breath, is from flowing,
   swelling, rushing, which gives the sense of violent action and passion.
   See animal.]

   Violent hatred accompanied with active opposition; active enmity.
   Animosity differs from enmity which may be secret and inactive; and it
   expresses a less criminal passion than malice. animosity seeks to gain
   a cause or destroy an enemy or rival, from hatred or private interest;
   malice seeks revenge for the sake of giving pain.

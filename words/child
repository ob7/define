   CHILD, n.

   1. A son or a daughter; a male or female descendant, in the first
   degree; the immediate progeny of parents; applied to the human race,
   and chiefly to a person when young. The term is applied to infants from
   their birth; but the time when they cease ordinarily to be so called,
   is not defined by custom. In strictness, a child is the shoot, issue or
   produce of the parents, and a person of any age, in respect to the
   parents, is a child.

   An infant.

   Hagar cast the child under one of the shrubs. Gen. 21.

   It signifies also a person of more advanced years.

   Jephthas daughter was his only child. Judges 11.

   The child shall behave himself proudly. Is. 3.

   A curse will be on those who corrupt the morals of their children.

   The application of child to a female in opposition to a male, as in
   Shakspeare, is not legitimate.

   2. One weak in knowledge, experience, judgment or attainments; as, he
   is a mere child.

   3. One young in grace. 1 John 2.

   One who is unfixed in principles. Eph. 4.

   4. One who is born again, spiritually renewed and adopted; as a child
   of God.

   5. One who is the product of another; or whose principles and morals
   are the product of another.

   6. In the plural, the descendants of a man however remote; as the
   children of Israel; the children of Edom.

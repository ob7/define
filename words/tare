[1]tare

   TARE, n. [I know not the origin of this word. See the next word.]

   1. A weed that grows among corn.

   Declare to us the parable of the tares of the field. Matt.13.

   2. In agriculture, a plant of the vetch kind, of which there are two
   sorts, the purple flowered spring or summer tare, and the
   purple-flowered wild or winter tare. It is much cultivated in England
   for fodder.

                                  TARE, n.

   1. In commerce, deficiency in the weight or quantity of goods by reason
   of the weight of the cask, bag or other thing containing the commodity,
   and which is weighed with it; hence, the allowance or abatement of a
   certain weight or quantity from the weight or quantity of a commodity
   sold in a cask, chest, bag or the like, which the seller makes to the
   buyer on account of the weight of such cask, chest or bag; or the
   abatement may be on the price of the commodity sold. When the tare is
   deducted, the remainder is called the net or neat weight.

             TARE, v.t. To ascertain or mark the amount of tare.

                  TARE, old pret. of tear. WE now use tore.

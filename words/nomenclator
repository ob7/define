   NOMENCLATOR

   1. A person who calls things or persons by their names. In Rome,
   candidates for office were attended each by a nomenclator, who informed
   the candidate of the names of the persons they met, and whose votes
   they wished to solicit.

   2. In modern usage, a person who gives names to things, or who settles
   and adjusts the names of things in any art or science.

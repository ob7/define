[1]leg

   LEG, n.

   1. The limb of an animal, used in supporting the body and in walking
   and running; properly, that part of the limb from the knee to the foot,
   but in a more general sense, the whole limb, including the thigh, the
   leg and the foot.

   2. The long or slender support of any thing; as the leg of a table.

   To make a leg, to bow; a phrase introduced probably by the practice of
   drawing the right leg backward. [Little used.]

   To stand on one's own legs, to support one's self; to trust to one's
   own strength or efforts without aid.

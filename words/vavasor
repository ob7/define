   vavasour, valvasour. It is said to be from vassal. But qu.]

   Camden holds that the vavasor was next below a baron. Du Cange
   maintains that there were two sorts of vavasors; the greater, who held
   of the king, such as barons and counts; and the lesser, called
   valvasini, who held of the former. The dignity or rank is no longer in
   use, and the name is known only in books.

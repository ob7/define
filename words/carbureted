   CARBURETED, a. Combined with carbon, or holding carbon in colution; as
   carbureted hydrogen gas. Carbureted hydrogen consists of one prime
   equivalent of each. Carbureted hydrogen gas is called hydro-carbonate,
   being resolvable into carbonic acid and water, by combustion with
   oxygen. Carbureted is applied to gaseous compounds. Thus we say
   carbureted hydrogen, instead of carburet of hydrogen.

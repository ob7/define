[1]vow

   VOW, n.

   1. A solemn promisemade to God, or by a pagan to his deity. The Roman
   generals when they went to war, sometimes made a vow that they would
   build a temple to some favorite deity, if he would give them victory. A
   vow is a promise of something to be given or done hereafter.

   A person is constituted a religious by taking three vows, of chastity,
   of poverty, and of obedience. Among the Isrealites, the vows of
   children were not binding, unless ratified by the express or tacit
   consent of their father. Num. 30.

   2. A solemn promise; as the vows of unchangeable love and fidelity. In
   a moral and religious sense, vows are promises to God, as they appeal
   to God to witness their sincerity, and the violation of them is a most
   heinous offense.

                                  VOW, v.t.

   1. To give, consecrate or dedicate to God by a solemn promise. When
   Jacob went to Mesopotamia, he vowed to God a tenth of this substance,
   and his own future devotion to his service. Gen. 28.

   When thou vowest a vow, defer not to pay it. Eccles. 5.

   2. To devote.

      VOW, v.i. To make vows or solemn promises. He that vows, must be
                             careful to perform.

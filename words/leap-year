[1]leap-year

   LE'AP-YEAR, n. Blissextile, a year containing 366 days; every fourth
   year, which leaps over a day more than a common year. Thus in common
   years, if the first day of March is on Monday, the present year, it
   will, the next year, fall on Tuesday, but in leap-year it will leap to
   Wednesday; for leap-year contains a day more than a common year, a day
   being added to the month of February.

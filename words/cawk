   CAWK, n. A name given by miners to certain specimens of the compact
   sulphate of baryte. These are of a white, gray or fawn color, often
   irregular in figure, but sometimes resembling a number of small convex
   lenses set in a ground.

   This name is sometimes given to masses composed of concentric lamellar
   concretions.

[1]figurative

   FIG'URATIVE, a.

   1. Representing something else; representing by resemblance; typical.

   This they will say, was figurative, and served by God's appointment but
   for a time, to shadow out the true glory of a more divine sanctity.

   2. Representing by resemblance; not literal or direct. A figurative
   expression, is one in which the words are used in a sense different
   from that in which they are ordinarily used as,

   Slander, whose edge is sharper than the sword.

   3. Abounding with figures of speech; as a description highly
   figurative.

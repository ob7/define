   REE'F-TACKLE, n. A tackle upon deck, communicating with its pendant,
   and passing through a block at the top-mast head, and through a hole in
   the top-sail-yard-arm, is attached to a cringle below the lowest reef;
   used to pull the skirts of the top-sails close to the extremities of
   the yards to lighten the labor of reefing.

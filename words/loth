   LOTH, a. [In America, the primitive pronunciation of lath, that is,
   lawth, is retained in the adjective, which is written loth. The verb
   would be better written lothe, in analogy with cloth, clothe. See
   Loth.]

   Disliking; unwilling; reluctant. He was loth to leave the company. [See
   Loth.]

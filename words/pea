[1]pea

   PEA, n. [L. pisum.] A plant and its fruit of the genus Pisum, of many
   varieties. This plant has a papilionaceous flower,and the pericarp is a
   legume, called in popular language a pod. In the plural, we write peas,
   for two or more individual seeds, but pease, for an indefinite number
   in quantity of bulk. We write two,three or four peas, but a bushel of
   pease. [This practice is arbitrary.]

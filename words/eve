[1]eve

   EVE, n. The consort of Adam, and mother of the human race; so called by
   Adam, because she was the mother of all living. In this case,the word
   would properly belong to the Hebrew. But the Hebrew name is havah or
   chavah, coinciding with the verb, to shew, to discover, and Parkhurst
   hence denominates Eve, the manifester. In the Septuagint, Eve, in
   Gen.3.20, is rendered life; but in Gen.4.1,

   it is rendered Euan or Evan. The reason of this variation is not
   obvious, as the Hebrew is the same in both passages. In Russ. Eve is
   Evva. In the Chickasaw language of America, a wife is called awah, says
   Adair.

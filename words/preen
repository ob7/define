   PREEN, n. A forked instrument used by clothiers in dressing cloth.

   PREEN, v.t. To clean, compose and dress the feathers, as fowls, to
   enable them to glide more easily through the air or water. For this
   purpose they are furnished with two glands on their rump, which secrete
   an oily substance into a bag, from which they draw it with the bill and
   spread it over their feathers.

[1]disproportionable

   DISPROPORTIONABLE, a. Disproportional; not in proportion; unsuitable in
   form, size or quantity to something else; inadequate. [Note. The sense
   in which this word is used is generally anomalous. In its true sense,
   that may be made disproportional, it is rarely or never used. The
   regular word which ought to be used is disproportional, as used by
   Locke.]

[1]swamp

   SWAMP, n. Spungy land; low ground filled with water; soft wet ground.
   In New England, I believe this word is never applied to marsh, or the
   boggy land made by the overflowing of salt water, but always to low
   soft ground in the interior country; wet and spungy land, but not
   usually covered with water. This is the true meaning of the word.
   Swamps are often mowed. In England, the word is explained in books by
   boggy land, morassy or marshy ground.

   SWAMP, v.t. To plunge, whelm or sink in a swamp; to plunge into
   difficulties inextricable.

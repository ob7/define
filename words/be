[1]be

   BE, v.i. substantive, ppr.being; pp.been.[The sense is to stand, remain
   or be fixed; hence to continue. This verb is defective, and its defects
   are supplied by verbs from other roots, as, is, was, were, which have
   no radical connection with be. The case is the same with the
   substantive verb in most languages.]

   1. To be fixed; to exist; to have a real state or existence,for a
   longer or shorter time.

   Let this mind be in you, which was in Christ Jesus. Phil.2.

                     To be, contents his natural desire.

   2. To be made to be; to become.

             And they twain shall be one flesh. Math.19. Jer.32.

              3. To remain. Let the garment be as it was made.

   4. To be present in a place. Where was I at the time? When will you be
   at my house?

   5. To have a particular manner of being or happening; as, how is this
   affair? how was it? what were the circumstances?

   This verb is used as an auxiliary in forming the tenses of other verbs,
      and particularly in giving them the passive form; as, he has been
    disturbed. It forms, with the infinitive, a particular future tense,
   which often expresses duty, necessity or purpose; as, government is to
                 be supported; we are to pay our just debts.

             Let be is to omit,or leave untouched; to let alone.

                          Let be,said he, my prey.

   BE, a prefix, as in because, before, beset, bedeck,is the same word as
    by. It is common to the English, Saxon, Gothic, German, Dutch, Danish
      and Swedish languages. It occurs probably in the Russian, but is
   written po, as it is in possideo and a few other words in the Latin. It
    denotes nearness, closeness, about, or, at, from some root signifying
                       to pass or to press. [See By.]

   That this word is the Shemitic, used as a prefix, is certain, not only
   from its general applications, which may be seen by comparing the uses
     of the word, in the Heb. for instance, with those in the Saxon; but
   from its use in particular phrases, particularly in its use before the
                   name of the Supreme being in swearing.

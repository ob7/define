[1]vicinage

   VIC'INAGE, n. [from L. vicinia, neighborhood; vicinus, near.]

   Neighborhood; the place or places adjoining or near. A jury must be of
   the vicinage, or body of the country.

   In law, common because of vicinage, is where the inhabitants of two
   townships contiguous to each other, have usually intercommoned with one
   another; the beasts of one straying into the other's fields without
   molestation from either.

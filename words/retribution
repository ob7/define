[1]retribution

   RETRIBU'TION, n.

   1. Repayment; return accommodated to the action; reward; compensation.

   In good offices and due retributions, we may not be pinching and
   niggardly.

   2. A gratuity or present given for services in the place of a salary.

   3. The distribution of rewards and punishments at the general judgment.

   It is a strong argument for a state of retribution hereafter, that in
   this world virtuous persons are very often unfortunate, and vicious
   persons prosperous.

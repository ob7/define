[1]stanza

   STANZA, n. In poetry, a number of lines or verses connected with each
   other, and ending in a full point or pause; a part of a poem containing
   every variation of measure in that poem. A stanza may contain verses of
   a different length or number of syllables, and a different number of
   verses; or ti may consist of verses of equal length. Stanzas are said
   to have been first introduced from the Italian into French poetry about
   the year 1580, and thence they were introduced into England. The
   versions of the Psalms present examples of various kinds of stanzas.

   Horace confines himself to one sort of verse or stanza in every ode.

   HEAVEN, n. hev'n.

   1. The region or expanse which surrounds the earth, and which appears
   above and around us, like an immense arch or vault, in which are seen
   the sun, moon and stars.

   2. Among christians, the part of space in which the omnipresent Jehovah
   is supposed to afford more sensible manifestations of his glory. Hence
   this is called the habitation of God, and is represented as the
   residence of angels and blessed spirits. Deut.26.

   The sanctified heart loves heaven for its purity, and God for his
   goodness.

   3. Among pagans, the residence of the celestial gods.

   4. The sky or air; the region of the atmosphere; or an elevated place;
   in a very indefinite sense. Thus we speak of a mountain reaching to
   heaven; the fowls of heaven; the clouds of heaven; hail or rain from
   heaven. Jer.9. Job.35.

   Their cities are walled to heaven. Deut.1.

   5. The Hebrews acknowledged three heavens; the air or aerial heavens;
   the firmament in which the stars are supposed to be placed; and the
   heaven of heavens, or third heaven, the residence of Jehovah.

   6. Modern philosophers divide the expanse above and around the earth
   into two parts,the atmosphere or aerial heaven, and the etherial heaven
   beyond the region of the air, in which there is supposed to be a thin,
   unresisting medium called ether.

   7. The Supreme Power; the Sovereign of heaven; god; as prophets sent by
   heaven.

   I have sinned against heaven. Luke 15.

   Shun the impious profaneness which scoffs at the
   institution of heaven.

   8. The pagan deities; celestials.

   And show the heavens more just.

   9. Elevation; sublimity.

   O! for a muse of fire, that would ascend

   The brightest heaven of invention.

                   10. Supreme felicity; great happiness.

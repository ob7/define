   KNOW, v.t. no. pret. knew; pp. known. [L. nosco, cognosco, Gr. although
   much varied in orthography. Nosco makes novi, which, with g or c
   prefixed, gnovi or cnovi, would coincide with know, knew. So L. cresco,
   crevi, coincides with grow, grew. The radical sense of knowing is
   generally to take, receive, or hold.]

   1. To perceive with certainty; to understand clearly; to have a clear
   and certain perception of truth, fact, or any thing that actually
   exists. To know a thing pre

   includes all doubt or uncertainty of its existence. We know what we see
   with our eyes, or perceive by other senses. We know that fire and water
     are different substances. We know that truth and falsehood express
     ideas incompatible with each other. We know that a circle is not a
     square. We do not know the truth of reports, nor can we always know
                              what to believe.

   2. To be informed of; to be taught. It is not unusual for us to say we
   know things from information, when we rely on the veracity of the
   informer.

   3. To distinguish; as, to know one man from another. We know a fixed
   star from a planet by its twinkling.

   4. To recognize by recollection, remembrance, representation or
   description. We do not always know a person after a long absence. We
   sometimes know a man by having seen his portrait, or having heard him
   described.

   5. To be no stranger to; to be familiar. This man is well known to us.

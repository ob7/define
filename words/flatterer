   FLAT'TERER, n. One who flatters; a fawner; a wheedler; one who praises
   another, with a view to please him, to gain his favor, or to accomplish
   some purpose.

   When I tell him he hates flatterers,

   He says he does; being then most flattered.

   The most abject flatterers degenerate into the greatest tyrants.

[1]yell

   YELL, v.i. [It agrees in elements with call.] To cry out with a hideous
   noise; to cry or scream as with agony or horror. Savages yell most
   frightfully when they are rushing to the first onset of battle.

   Nor the night raven, that still deadly yells.

                   YELL, n. A sharp, loud, hideous outcry.

   Their hideous yells rend the dark welkin.

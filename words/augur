[1]augur

   AU'GUR, n. [L. augur. The first syllable is from avis, a fowl; but the
   meaning and origin of the last syllable are not obvious.]

   1. Among the Romans, an officer whose duty was to foretell future
   events by the singing, chattering, flight and feeding of birds. There
   was a college or community of augers, originally three in number, and
   afterwards nine, four patricians, and five plebeians. They bore a staff
   or wand, and were held in great respect.

   2. One who pretends to foretell future events by omens.

   We all know that augur cannot look at augur without laughing.

         AU'GUR, v.i. To guess; to conjecture by signs or omens; to
                               prognosticate.

       AU'GUR, v.t. To predict or foretell; as, to augur ill success.

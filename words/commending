[1]commending

   COMMENDING, ppr. Praising; representing favorably; committing, or
   delivering in charge.

   Note: In imitation of the French, we are accustomed to use
   recommendation, &c., for commendation. But in most instances, it is
   better to use the word without the prefix re. A letter of commendation,
   is the preferable phrase.

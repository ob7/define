[1]indenture

   INDENT'URE,n. A writing containing a contract. Indentures are generally
   duplicates, laid together and indented, so that the two papers or
   parchments correspond to each other. But indenting is often neglected,
   while the writings or counterparts retain the name of indentures.

   INDENT'URE, v.t. To indent; to bind by indentures; as, to indenture an
   apprentice.

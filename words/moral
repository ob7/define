   MOR'AL, a. [L. moralis, from mos, moris, manner.]

   1. Relating to the practice, manners or conduct of men as social beings
   in relation to each other, and with reference to right and wrong. The
   word moral is applicable to actions that are good or evil, virtuous or
   vicious, and has reference to the law of God as the standard by which
   their character is to be determined. The word however may be applied to
   actions which affect only, or primarily and principally, a person's own
   happiness.

   Keep at the least within the compass of moral actions, which have in
   them vice or virtue.

   Mankind is broken loose from moral bands.

   2. Subject to the moral law and capable of moral actions; bound to
   perform social duties; as a moral agent or being.

   3. Supported by the evidence of reason or probability; founded on
   experience of the ordinary course of things; as moral certainty,
   distinguished from physical or mathematical certainty or demonstration.

   Physical and mathematical certainty may be stiled infallible, and moral
   certainty may be properly stiled indubitable.

   Things of a moral nature may be proved by moral arguments.

   4. Conformed to rules of right, or to the divine law respecting social
   duties; virtuous; just; as when we say, a particular action is not
   moral.

   5. Conformed to law and right in exterior deportment; as, he leads a
   good moral life.

   6. Reasoning or instructing with regard to vice and virtue.

   While thou, a moral fool, sitt'st still and cri'st.

   7. In general, moral denotes something which respects the conduct of
   men and their relations as social beings whose actions have a bearing
   on each others's rights and happiness, and are therefore right or
   wrong, virtuous or vicious; as moral character; moral views; moral
   knowledge; moral sentiments; moral maxims; moral approbation; moral
   doubts; moral justice; moral virtue; moral obligations, &c. Or moral
   denotes something which respects the intellectual powers of man, as
   distinct form his physical powers. Thus we speak of moral evidence,
   moral arguments, moral persuasion, moral certainty, moral force; which
   operate on the mind.

   Moral law, the law of God which prescribes the moral or social duties,
                  and prohibits the transgression of them.

       Moral sense, an innate or natural sense of right and wrong; an
     instinctive perception of what is right or wrong in moral conduct,
     which approves some actions and disapproves others, independent of
       education or the knowledge of any positive rule or law. But the
           existence of any such moral sense is very much doubted.

    Moral philosophy, the science of manners and duty; the science which
     treats of the nature and condition of man as a social being, of the
   duties which result form his social relations, and the reasons on which
                              they are founded.

    MOR'AL, n. Morality; the doctrine or practice of the duties of life.
                              [Not much used.]

   1. The doctrine inculcated by a fiction; the accommodation of a fable
   to form the morals.

   The moral is the first business of the poet.

                   MOR'AL, v.i. To moralize. [Not in use.]

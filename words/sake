[1]sake

   SAKE, n. [Heb. to press or oppress. The primary sense is to strain,
   urge, press or drive forward, and this is from the same root as seek,
   essay and L. sequor, whence we have pursue and prosecute. We have
   analogous words in cause, thing, and the L. res.]

   1. Final cause; end; purpose; or rather the purpose of obtaining. I
   open a window for the sake of air, that is, to obtain it, for the
   purpose of obtaining air. I read for the sake of instruction, that is,
   to obtain it. Sake then signifies primarily effort to obtain, and
   secondarily purpose of obtaining. The hero fights for the sake of
   glory; men labor for the sake of subsistence or wealth.

   2. Account; regard to any person or thing.

   I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake. Gen. 8.

   Save me for thy mercies' sake. Ps. 6.

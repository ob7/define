   ANOINT', v.t. [L. ungo.]

   1. To pour oil upon; to smear or rub over with oil or unctuous
   substances; also to spread over, as oil. We say, the man anoints
   another, or the oil anoints him.

   2. To consecrate by unction, or the use of oil.

   Thou shalt anoint the altar, and sanctify it. Ex. 29.

   3. To smear or daub.

   He anointed the eyes of the blind man with clay. John 9.

   4. To prepare, in allusion to the consecrating use of oil.

   Anoint the shield. Isaiah 21.

   To anoint the head with oil, Ps. 23 seems to signify to communicate the
   consolations of the Holy Spirit.

   The use of oil in consecrations, was of high antiquity. Kings, prophets
   and priests were set apart or consecrated to their offices by the use
   of oil. Hence the peculiar application of the term anointed to Jesus
   Christ.

[1]concerning

   CONCERNING, ppr. Pertaining to; regarding; having relation to.

   The Lord hath spoken good concerning Israel. Numbers 10.

   I have accepted thee concerning this thing. Genesis 19.

   This word has been considered a preposition, but most improperly;
   concerning, when so called, refers to a verb, sentence or proposition;
   as in the first example, the word applies to the preceding afirmation.
   The Lord hath spoken good, which speaking good is concerning Israel.
   Concerning, in this case, refers to the first clause of the sentence.

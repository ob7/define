[1]should

   SHOULD. shood. The preterit of shall, but now used as an auxiliary
   verb, either in the past time or conditional present. "He should have
   paid the debt at the time the note became due." Should here denotes
   past time. "I should ride to town this day if the weather would
   permit." Here should expresses present or future time conditionally. In
   the second and third persons, it denotes obligation or duty, as in the
   first example above.

   1. I should go. When should in this person is uttered without emphasis,
   it declares simply that an event would take place, on some condition or
   under circumstances.

   But when expressed with emphasis, should in this person denotes
   obligation, duty or determination.

   2. Thou shouldst go.

   CROOK, n. [G., the back, or ridge of an animal. L., a wrinkle, a
   circle; rough, hoarse. The radical sense of crook is to strain or draw;
   hence, to bend.]

   1. Any bend, turn or curve; or a bent or curving instrument. We speak
   of a crook in a stick of timber, or in a river; and any hook is a
   crook.

   2. A shepherd staff, curving at the end; a pastoral staff. When used by
   a bishop or abbot, it is called a crosier.

   He left his crook, he left his flocks.

   3. A gibbet.

   4. An artifice; a trick.

                                 CROOK, v.t.

   1. To bend; to turn from a straight line; to make a curve or hook.

   2. To turn from rectitude; to pervert.

   3. To thwart. [Little used.]

     CROOK, v.i. To bend or be bent; to be turned from a right line; to
                               curve; to wind.

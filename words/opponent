[1]opponent

   OPPO'NENT, a. [L. opponens, oppono; ob and pono, to set, put or lay,
   that is, to thrust against; Heb. to build, that is, to set, to found,
   L. fundo.] That opposes; opposite; adverse.

   OPPO'NENT, n. One that opposes; particularly, one that opposes in
   controversy, disputation or argument. It is sometimes applied to the
   person that begins a dispute by raising objections to a tenet or
   doctrine, and is correlative to defendant or respondent. In common
   usage, however, it is applicable to either party in a controversy,
   denoting any person who opposes another or his cause. Opponent may
   sometimes be used for adversary, and for antagonist, but not with
   strict propriety, as the word does not necessarily imply enmity nor
   bodily strife. Nor is it well used in the sense of rival or competitor.

[1]supernatural

   SUPERNAT'URAL, a. [super and natural.] Being beyond or exceeding the
   powers or laws of nature; miraculous. A supernatural event is one which
   is not produced according to the ordinary or established laws of
   natural things. Thus if iron has more specific gravity than water, it
   will sink in that fluid; and the floating of iron on water must be a
   supernatural event. Now no human being can alter a law of nature; the
   floating of iron on water therefore must be caused by divine power
   specially exerted to suspend, in this instance,a law of nature. Hence
   supernatural events or miracles can be produced only by the immediate
   agency of divine power.

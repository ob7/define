[1]selfishly

   SELF'ISHLY, adv. The exclusive of a person to his own interest or
   happiness; or that supreme self-love or self-preference, which leads a
   person in his actions to direct his purposes to the advancement of his
   own interest, power or happiness, without regarding the interest of
   others. Selfishness, in its worst or unqualified sense, is the ver
   essence of human depravity, and it stands in direct opposition to
   benevolence, which is the essence of the divine character. As God is
   love, so man, in his natural state, is selfishness.

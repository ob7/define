[1]archipelago

   ARCHIPEL'AGO, n. [Authors are not agreed as to the origin of this word.
   Some suppose it to be compounded of Gr. chief, and sea; others of the
   Egean sea.]

   In a general sense, a sea interspersed with many isles; but
   particularly the sea which separates Europe from Asia, otherwise called
   the Egean Sea. It contains the Grecian isles, called Cyclades and
   Sporades.

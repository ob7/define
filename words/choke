   CHOKE, v.t.

   1. To stop the passage of the breath, by filling the windpipe or

   partial stoppage, as to choke with dirt or smoke; or an entire stoppage
   that causes death; to suffocate; to strangle. Mark 5.

   entrance of a harbor, or any passage.

   3. To hinder by obstruction or impediments; to hinder or check growth,
   expansion, or progress; as, to choke plants; to choke the spreading of

   CORSNED, n. The morsel of execration, or curse; a piece of bread
   consecrated by exorcism, and to be swallowed by a suspected person, as
   a trial of his innocence. If guilty, it was supposed the bread would
   produce convulsions and paleness, and find no passage. If innocent, it
   was believed it would turn to nourishment.

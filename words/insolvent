   INSOLV'ENT, a. [L. in and solvens, solvo, to solve, to free, to pay.]

   1. Not having money, goods or estate sufficient to pay all debts; as an
   insolvent debtor.

   2. Not sufficient to pay all the debts of the owner; as an insolvent
   estate.

   3. Respecting insolvent debtors; relieving an insolvent debtor from
   imprisonment for debt, or form liability to arrest and imprisonment for
   debts previously contracted; as an insolvent law.

   Insolvent law, or act of insolvency, a law which liberates a debtor
   from imprisonment, or exempts him from liability to arrest and
   imprisonment on account of any debt previously contracted. These terms
   may be considered as generic, comprehending also bankrupt laws, which
   protect a man's future acquisitions from his creditors. But in a
   limited sense, as the words are now generally used, an insolvent law
   extends only to protect the person of the debtor form imprisonment on
   account of debts previously contracted.

              INSOLV'ENT, n. A debtor unable to pay his debts.

[1]mistaken

   MISTA'KEN. In the use of this participle, there is a peculiarity which
   ought to be carefully noticed. When used of persons, it signified to be
   in an error, to be wrong; as, I am mistaken, you are mistaken, he is
   mistaken. But when used of things, it signified misunderstood,
   misconceived; as, the sense of the passage is mistaken, that is, not
   rightly understood.

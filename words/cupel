[1]cupel

   CUPEL, n. [L., a little cup.] A small cup or vessel used in refining
   metals. It retains them while in a metallic state, but when changed by
   fire into a fluid scoria, it absorbs them. Thus when a mixture of lead
   with gold or silver is heated in a strong fire, the lead is oxydated
   and vitrified, and sinks into the substance of the cupel, while the
   gold or silver remains pure. This kind of vessel is made usually of
   phosphate of lim, or the residue of burnt bones, rammed into a mold,
   which gives it its figure.

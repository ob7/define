   UNIVERS'ALLY, adv. With extension to the whole; in a manner to
   comprehend all; without exception. Air is a fluid universally diffused.
   God's laws are universally binding on his creatures.

   general. This kind of universality is by the schoolmen called moral, as
   admitting of some exceptions, in distinction from metophysical, which
   precludes all exceptions.]

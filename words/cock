   which having no appropriate or distinctive name, are called dunghill
   fowls or barn-door fowls.

   2. A weather-cock; a vane in shape of a cock. [It is usually called a
   weather-cock.]

   3. A spout; an instrument to draw out or discharge liquor from a cask,
   vat or pipe; so named from its projection.

   5. A small conical pile of hay, so shaped for shedding rain; called in

   attached, and which, being impelled by a spring, strikes fire, and

   cock itself is a bot.

[1]elocution

   ELOCU'TION, n. [L. elocutio, from eloquor; e and loquor, to speak.]

   1. Pronunciation; the utterance or delivery of words, particularly in
   public discourses and arguments. We say of elocution, it is good or
   bad; clear, fluent or melodious.

   Elocution, which anciently embraced style and the whole art of
   rhetoric, now signifies manner of delivery.

   2. In rhetoric, elocution consists of elegance, composition and
   dignity; and Dryden uses the word as nearly synonymous with eloquence,
   the act of expressing thoughts with elegance or beauty.

   3. Speech; the power of speaking.

   Whose taste--gave elocution to the mute.

   4. In ancient treatises on oratory, the wording of a discourse; the
   choice and order of words; composition; the act of framing a writing or
   discourse.

[1]liar

   LIA'R, n. [from lie.]

   1. A person who knowingly utters falsehood; one who declares to another
   as a fact what he knows to be not true, and with an intention to
   deceive him. The uttering of falsehood by mistake, and without an
   intention to deceive, does not constitute one a liar.

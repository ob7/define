[1]abet

   ABET' v.t. [Sax. betan, gebatan; properly to push forward, to advance;
   hence to amend, to revive, to restore, to make better; and applied to
   fire, to increase the flame, to excite, to promote. Hence to aid by
   encouraging or instigating. Hence in Saxon, "Na bete nan man that fyr."
   Let no man bet, [better, excite] the fire, LL. Ina. 78.]

   1. To encourage by aid or countenance, but now used chiefly in a bad
   sense. "To abet an opinion," in the sense of support, is used by Bishop
   Cumberland; but this use is hardly allowable.

   2. In law, to encourage, counsel, incite or assist in a criminal act.

     ABET', n. The act of aiding or encouraging in a crime. [Not used.]

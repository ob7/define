   GE'ORAMA, n. [Gr. the earth, and view.] An instrument or machine which
   exhibits a very complete view of the earth, lately invented in Paris.
   It is a hollow sphere of forty feet diameter, formed by thirty six bars
   of iron representing the parallels and meridians, and covered with a
   bluish cloth, intended to represent seas and lakes. The land, mountains
   and rivers are painted on paper and pasted on this cover.

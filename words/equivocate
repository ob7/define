[1]equivocate

   EQUIV'OCATE, v.i. To use words of a doubtful signification; to express
   one's opinions in terms which admit of different senses; to use
   ambiguous expressions. To equivocate is the dishonorable work of
   duplicity. The upright man will not equivocate in his intercourse with
   his fellow men.

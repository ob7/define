   RES'IN,n. s as z. [L., Gr. to flow.]

   An inflammable substance, hard when cool, but viscid when heated,
   exuding in a fluid state from certain kinds of trees, as pine, either
   spontaneously or by incision. Resins are soluble in oils and alcohol,
   and are said to be nothing but oils concreted by combination with
   oxygen. Resins differ from gums, which are vegetable mucilage; and they
   are less sweet and odorous than balsams.

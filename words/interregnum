[1]interregnum

   INTERREG'NUM, n. [L. inter and regnum, rule or reign.] The time in
   which a throne is vacant, between the death or abdication of a king and
   the accession of his successor. An interregnum, in strictness, can
   happen only in governments where the king is elective; for in
   hereditary kingdoms, the reign of the successor commences at the moment
   of his predecessor;s death or demise. The word however is used with
   more latitude.

   BER'RY, n.

   1. A succulent or pulpy fruit, containing naked seeds. Or in more
   technical language, a succulent pulpy pericarp, or seed vessel, without
   valves, containing several seeds, which are naked, that is, which have
   no covering but the pulp and rind. It is commonly round or oval. This
   botanical definition includes the orange and other like fruits. But in
   popular language, berry extends only to the smaller fruits, as
   strawberry, gooseberry, &c.,containing seeds or granules.

   2. A mound. [for barrow.]

                  BER'RY, v.i. To bear or produce berries.

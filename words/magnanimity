   Greatness of mind; that elevation or dignity of soul, which encounters
   danger and trouble with tranquillity and firmness, which raises the
   possessor above revenge, and makes him delight in acts of benevolence,
   which makes him disdain injustice and meanness, and prompts him to
   sacrifice personal ease, interest and safety for the accomplishment of
   useful and noble objects.

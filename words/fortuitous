[1]fortuitous

   FORTU'ITOUS, a. [L. fortuitus, from the root of fors, forte, fortuna.
   The primary sense is to come, to fall, to happen. See Fare.]

   Accidental; casual; happening by chance; coming or occurring
   unexpectedly, or without any known cause. We speak of fortuitous
   events, when they occur without our foreseeing or expecting them, and
   of a fortuitous concourse of atoms, when we suppose the concourse not
   to result from the design and power of a controlling agent. But an
   event cannot be in fact fortuitous. [See Accidental and Casual.]

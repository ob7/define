   ACCUBA'TION, n. [L. accubatio, a reclingin, from ad and cubo, to lie
   down. See Cube.]

   A lying or reclining on a couch, as the ancients at their meals. The
   manner was to recline on low beds or couches with the head resting on a
   pillow or on the elbow. Two or three men lay on one bed, the feet of
   one extended behind the back of another. This practice was not
   permitted among soldiers, children and servants; nor was it known,
   until luxury had corrupted manners.

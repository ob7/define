   NARWAL, n. The Monodon monoceros, a cetaceous animal found in the
   northern seas, which grows to twenty feet in length. The spiracle of
   this animal is on the anterior part of the skull. When young it has two
   teeth or horns, but when old it has but one, which projects from the
   upper jaw and is spiral. From this circumstance of its having one horn
   only, it has obtained the name of the sea unicorn, or unicorn fish.

[1]geode

   GE'ODE,n. [Gr. earth.] In mineralogy, a round or roundish lump of agate
   or other mineral, or a mere incrustation. Its interior is sometimes
   empty, and in this case the sides of its cavity are lined with
   crystals, as in agate balls. Sometimes it contains a solid movable
   nucleus; and sometimes it is filled with an earthy matter different
   from the envelop.

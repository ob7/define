   LIP, n. [L. labium, labrum.]

   1. The edge or border of the mouth. The lips are two fleshy or muscular
   parts, composing the exterior of the mouth in man and many other
   animals. In man, the lips, which may be opened or closed at pleasure,
   form the covering of the teeth, and are organs of speech essential to
   certain articulations. Hence the lips, by a figure, denote the mouth,
   or all the organs of speech, and sometimes speech itself. Job. 2.

   2. The edge of any thing; as the lip of a vessel.

   3. In botany, one of the two opposite divisions of a labiate corol. The
   upper is called the helmet, and the lower the beard. Also, an appendage
   to the flowers of the orchises, considered by Linne as a nectary.

   To make a lip, to drop the under lip in sullenness or contempt.

                             LIP, v.t. To kiss.

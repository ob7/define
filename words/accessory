[1]accessory

   AC'CESSORY, a. [L. Accessorius, from accessus, accedo. See Accede. This
   word is accented on the first syllable on account of the derivatives,
   which require a secondary accent on the third; but the natural accent
   of accessory is on the second syllable, and thus it is often pronounced
   by good speakers.]

   1. Acceding; contributing; aiding in producing some effect, or acting
   in subordination to the principal agent. Usually, in a bad sense, as
   John was accessory to the felony.

   2. Aiding in certain acts or effects in a secondary manner, as
   accessory sounds in music.

                               AC'CESSORY, n.

   1. In law, one who is guilty of a felony, not by committing the offense
   in person or as principal, but by advising or commanding another to
   commit the crime, or by concealing the offender. There may be
   accessories in all felonies, but not in treason. An accessory before
   the fact, is one who counsels or commands another to commit a felony,
   and is not present when the act is executed; after the fact, when one
   receives and conceals the offender.

   2. That which accedes or belongs to something else, as its principal.

   Accessory nerves, in anatomy, a pair of nerves, which arising from the
   medulla in the vertebers of the neck, ascend and enter the skull; then
   passing out with the par vagum, are distributed into the muscles of the
   neck and shoulders.

   Accessory, among painters, an epithet given to parts of a history-piece
   which are merely ornamental, as vases, armor, &c.

[1]votary

   VO'TARY, a. [from L. votus, from voveo. See Vow.]

   Devoted; promised; consecrated by a vow or promise; consequent on a
   vow.

   Votary resolution is made equipollent to custom.

    VO'TARY, n. One devoted, consecrated or engaged by a vow or promise;
   hence more generally, one devoted, given or addicted to some particular
    service, worship, study or state of life. Every goddess of antiquity
   had her votaries. Every pursuit or study has now its votaries. One is a
   votary to mathematics, another is a votary to music, and alas, a great
           portion of the world are votaries of sensual pleasures.

   It was the coldness of the votary, not the prayer, which was in fault.

   INTOX'ICATE, v.t. [in and L. toxicum, which, Pliny informs us, is from
   taxa, a species of tree.]

   1. To inebriate; to make drunk; as with spirituous liquor.

   As with new wine intoxicated both,

   They swim in mirth--

   2. To excite the spirits to a kind of delirium; to elate to enthusiasm,
   frenzy or madness. Success may sometimes intoxicate a man of sobriety.
   An enthusiast may be intoxicated and zeal.

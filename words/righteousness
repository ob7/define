[1]righteousness

   RIGHTEOUSNESS, n. ri'chusness.

   1. Purity of heart and rectitude of life; conformity of heart and life
   to the divine law. Righteousness, as used in Scripture and theology, in
   which it is chiefly used, is nearly equivalent to holiness,
   comprehending holy principles and affections of heart, and conformity
   of life to the divine law. It includes all we call justice, honesty and
   virtue, with holy affections; in short, it is true religion.

   2. Applied to God, the perfection or holiness of his nature; exact
   rectitude; faithfulness.

   3. The active and passive obedience of Christ, by which the law of God
   is fulfilled. Daniel 9.

   4. Justice; equity between man and man. Luke 1.

   5. The cause of our justification.

   The Lord our righteousness. Jer. 23.

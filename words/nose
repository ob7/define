   NOSE, n.

   1. The prominent part of the face which is the organ of smell,
   consisting of two similar cavities called nostrils. The nose serves
   also to modulate the voice in speaking, and to discharge the tears
   which flow through the lachrymal ducts. Through this organ also the air
   usually passes in respiration, and it constitutes no small part of the
   beauty of the face. In man, the nose is situated near the middle of the
   face; but in quadrupeds, the nose is at or near the lower extremity of
   the head.

   2. The end of any thing; as the nose of a bellows.

   3. Scent; sagacity.

   We are not offended with a dog for a better nose than his master.

   To lead by the nose, to lead blindly.

   To be led by the nose, to follow another obsequiously, or to be led
   without resistance or enquiring the reason.

   To thrust one's nose into the affairs of others, to meddle officiously
   in other people's matters; to be a busy-body.

   To put one's nose out of joint, to alienate the affections from
   another.

                                 NOSE, v.t.

   1. To small; to scent.

   2. To face; to oppose to the face.

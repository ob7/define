[1]entrochite

   EN'TROCHITE, n. [Gr. a wheel.] A kind of extraneous fossil, usually
   about an inch in length, and made up of round joints, which, when
   separated, are called trochites. These seem to be composed of the same
   kind of substance as the fossil shells of the echini. They are striated
   from the center to the circumference and have a cavity in the middle.
   They appear to be the petrified arms of the seastar, called stella
   arborescens.

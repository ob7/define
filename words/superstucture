   SUPERSTUCT'URE, n. Any structure or edifice built on something else;
   particularly, the building raised on a foundation. This word is used to
   distinguish what is erected on a wall or foundation from the foundation
   itself.

   1. Any thing erected on a foundation or basis. In education, we begin
   with teaching languages as the foundation, and proceed to erect on that
   foundation the superstructure of science.

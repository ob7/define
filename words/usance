[1]usance

   U'SANCE, n. s as z.

   1. Use; proper employment.

   2. Usury; interest paid for money.

   3. In commerce, a determinate time fixed for the payment of bills of
   exchange, reckoned either from the day of their date, or the day of
   their acceptance. It is thus called because this time is settled by
   usage, or the custom of places on which the bills are drawn. In France,
   the usance for bills drawn from Spain and Portugal, is sixty days. At
   London, the usance for bills drawn from Holland, Germany or France is
   one month. The usance is very different in different countries and
   cities.

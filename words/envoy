[1]envoy

   EN'VOY, n. [L. via; Eng. way, contracted from viag, vag, or wag.]

   1. A person deputed by a prince or government, to negotiate a treaty,
   or transact other business, with a foreign prince or government. We
   usually apply the word to a public minister sent on a special occasion,
   or for one particular purpose; hence an envoy is distinguished from an
   embassador or permanent resident at a foreign court, and is of inferior
   rank. But envoys are ordinary and extraordinary, and the word may
   sometimes be applied to resident ministers.

   2. A common messenger. [Not in use.]

   3. Formerly, a postscript sent with compositions, to enforce them.

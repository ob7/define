[1]slave

   SLAVE, n.

   1. A person who is wholly subject to the will of another; one who has
   no will of his own, but whose person and services are wholly under the
   control of another. In the early state of the world, and to this day
   among some barbarous nations, prisoners of war are considered and
   treated as slaves. The slaves of modern times are more generally
   purchased, like horses and oxen.

   2. One who has lost the poser of resistance; or one who surrenders
   himself to any power whatever; as a slave to passion, to lust, to
   ambition.

   3. A mean person; one in the lowest state of life.

   4. A drudge; one who labors like a slave.

            SLAVE, v.i. To drudge; to toil; to labor as a slave.

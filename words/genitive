[1]genitive

   GEN'ITIVE, a. [L. genitivus, from the root of gender.]

   In grammar, an epithet given to a case in the declension of nouns,
   expressing primarily the thing from which something else proceeds; as
   filius patris, the son of a father; aqua fontis, the water of a
   fountain. But by custom this case expresses other relations,
   particularly possession or ownership; as animi magnitudo, greatness of
   mind, greatness possessed by or inherent in the mind. This case often
   expresses also that which proceeds from something else; as pater septem
   filiorum, the father of seven sons.

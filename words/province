[1]province

   PROV'INCE, n. [L. provincia; usually supposed to be formed from pro and
   vinco, to conquer. This is very doubtful, as provinco was not used by
   the Romans.]

   1. Among the Romans, a country of considerable extent, which being
   reduced under their dominion, was new-modeled, subjected to the command
   of an annual governor sent from Rome, and to such taxes and
   contributions as the Romans saw fit to impose. That part of France next
   to the Alps, was a Roman province, and still bears the name Provence.

   2. Among the moderns, a country belonging to a kingdom or state, either
   by conquest or colonization, usually situated at a distance from the
   kingdom or state, but more or less dependent on it or subject to it.
   Thus formerly, the English colonies in North America were provinces of
   Great Britain, as Nova Scotia and Canada still are. The provinces of
   the Netherlands formerly belonged to the house of Austria and to Spain.

   3. A division of a kingdom or state, of considerable extent. In
   England, a division of the ecclesiastical state under the jurisdiction
   of an archbishop, of which there are two, the province of Canterbury
   and that of York.

   4. A region of country; in a general sense; a tract; a large extent.

   Over many a tract

   Of heaven they march'd, and many a province wide.

   They never look abroad into the provinces of the intellectual world.

   5. The proper office or business of a person. It is the province of the
   judge to decide causes between individuals.

   The woman's province is to be careful in her economy, and chaste in her
   affection.

   BELI'E, v.t. [be and lie. See Lie.]

   1. To give the lie to; to show to be false; to charge with falsehood;
   as, the heart belies the tongue. It is rarely used of declarations; but
   of appearances and facts which show that declarations, or certain
   appearances and pretences are false and hypocritical. Hence.

   2. To counterfeit; to mimic; to feign resemblance.

   With dust, with horse's hoofs, that beat the ground,]

                And martial brass, belie the thunder's sound.

   3. To give a false representation.

   Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts.

   4. To tell lies concerning; to calumniate by false reports.

                         Thou dost belie him, Percy.

   5. To fill with lies.

   Slander doth belie all corners of the world. [Not legitimate]

[1]avocation

   AVOCA'TION, n. [See Vocation, Voice, Vocal.]

   1. The act of calling aside, or diverting from some employment; as an
   avocation from sin or from business.

   2. The business which calls aside. The word is generally used for the
   smaller affairs of life, or occasional calls which summon a person to
   leave his ordinary or principal business. The use of this word for
   vocation is very improper.

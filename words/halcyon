   HAL'CYON, n. hal'shon. [L. halcyon; Gr. a king-fisher.]

   The name anciently given to the king-fisher, otherwise called alcedo; a
   bird that was said to lay her eggs in nests, on rocks near the sea,
   during the calm weather about the winter solstice. Hence,

   HAL'CYON, a. Calm; quiet; peaceful; undisturbed; happy. Halcyon days
   were seven days before and as many after the winter solstice, when the
   weather was calm. Hence by halcyon days are now understood days of
   peace and tranquility.

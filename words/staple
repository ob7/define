   STAPLE, n. [G., a stake, a pile or heap, a staple, stocks, a mart. The
   primary sense of the root is to set, to fix. Staple is that which is
   fixed, or a fixed place, or it is a pile or store.]

   1. A settled mart or market; an emporium. In England, formerly, the
   kings staple was established in certain ports or towns, and certain
   goods could not be exported, without being first brought to these ports
   to be rated and charged with the duty payable to the king or public.
   The principal commodities on which customs were levied, were wool,
   skins and lether, and these were originally the staple commodities.
   Hence the words staple commodities, came in time to signify the
   principal commodities produced by a country for exportation or use.
   Thus cotton is the staple commodity of South Carolina, Georgia and
   other southern states of America. Wheat is the staple of Pennsylvania
   and New York.

   2. A city or town where merchants agree to carry certain commodities.

   3. The thread or pile of wool, cotton or flax. Thus we say, this is
   wool of a coarse staple, or fine staple. In America, cotton is of a
   short staple, long staple, fine staple, &c. The cotton of short staple
   is raised on the upland; the sea-island cotton is of a fine long
   staple.

   4. A loop of iron, or a bar or wire bent and formed with two points to
   be driven into wood, to hold a hook, pin, &c.

   Staple of land, the particular nature and quality of land.

                                 STAPLE, a.

   2. According to the laws of commerce; marketable; fit to be sold. [Not
   much used.]

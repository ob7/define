[1]quoth

   QUOTH, v.i. [L. inquio, contracted.]

   To say; to speak. This verb is defective, being used only in the first
   and third persons in the present and past tenses, as quoth I, quoth he,
   and the nominative always follows the verb. It is used only in
   ludicrous language, and has no variation for person, number or tense.

   PER'MANENT, a. [L.permanens, permaneo,per and maneo, to remain.]

   Durable; lasting; continuing in the same state, or without any change
   that destroys the form or nature of the thing. The laws, like the
   character of God, are unalterably permanent. Human laws and
   institutions may be to a degree permanent, but they are subject to
   change and overthrow. We speak of a permanent wall or building, a
   permanent bridge, when they are so constructed as to endure long; in
   which examples,permanent is equivalent to durable or lasting, but not
   to undecaying or unalterable. So we say, a permanent residence, a
   permanent intercourse, permanent friendship,when it continues a long
   time without interruption.

[1]copple-stones

   COPPLE-STONES, n. Lumps and fragments of stone broke from the adjacent
   cliffs, rounded by being bowled and tumbled to and again by the action
   of water. In New England, we pronounce this word cobble, cobble-stones,
   and if the word is a diminutive of cob, cop, a head, or cub, a heap, we
   follow the Welsh cob, as the English do the same word, cop, in the
   Saxon dialect. We apply the word to small round stones, from the size
   of an inch or two, to five or six inches or more, in diameter, wherever
   they may be found.

   GUM-RESIN, n. [See Resin.] A mixed juice of plants, consisting of resin
   and an extractive matter, which has been taken for a gummy substance.
   The gum-resins do not flow naturally from plants, but are mostly
   extracted by incision, in the form of white, yellow or red emulsive
   fluids, which dry and consolidate. The most important species are
   olibanum, galbanum, scammony, gamboge, euphorbium, assafetida,
   aloes,myrrh, and gum-ammoniac.

   Gum-resins are natural combinations of gum and resin.

   Gum-resins are composed of a gum or extractive matter, and a body
   intermediate between oil and resin; to which last they owe their
   peculiar properties.

[1]epitaph

   EP'ITAPH, n. [Gr. a sepulcher.]

   1. An inscription on a monument, in honor or memory of the dead.

   The epitaphs of the present day are crammed with fulsome compliments
   never merited.

   Can you look forward to the honor of a decorated coffin, a splendid
   funeral, a towering monument--it may be a lying epitaph.

   2. An eulogy, in prose or verse, composed without any intent to be
   engraven on a monument, as that on Alexander:

   "Sufficit huic tumulus, cui non sufficeret orbis."

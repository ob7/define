   BAS'ILIC, n. s as z. [L. basilica; Gr. a king.]

   Anciently, a public hall or court of judicature, where princes and
   magistrates sat to administer justice. It was a large hall, with
   aisles, porticoes, tribunes, and tribunals. The bankers also had a part
   allotted for their residence. These edifices, at first, were the
   palaces of princes, afterwards courts of justice, and finally converted
   into churches. Hence basilic now signifies a church, chapel,cathedral,
   or royal palace.

   BAS'ILIC, n. [See Basil.] The middle vein of the arm, or the interior
   branch of the axillary vein, so called by way of eminence.

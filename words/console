[1]console

   CONSOLE, v.t. [L. The primary sense is either to set or allay, to give
   rest or quiet, or the sense is to strengthen, in which case it
   coincides with the root of solid. The latter is most probable.] To
   comfort; to cheer the mind in distress or depression; to alleviate
   grief, and give refreshment to the mind or spirits; to give contentment
   or moderate happiness by relieving from distress.

   The promises of the gospel may well console the Christian in all the
   afflictions of life.

   It is a consoling reflection that the evils of life are temporary.

   I am much consoled by the reflection that the religion of Christ has
   been attacked in vain by all the wits and philosophers, and its triumph
   has been complete.

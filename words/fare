[1]fare

   FARE, v.i. [This word may be connected in origin with the Heb. to go,
   to pass.]

   1. To go; to pass; to move forward; to travel.

   So on he fares, and to the border comes of Eden.

   [In this literal sense the word is not in common use.]

   2. To be in any state, good or bad; to be attended with any
   circumstances or train of events, fortunate or unfortunate.

   So fares the stag among th' enraged hounds.

   So fared the knight between two foes.

   He fared very well; he fared very ill.

     Go further and fare worse. The sense is taken from going, having a
   certain course; hence, being subjected to a certain train of incidents.
    The rich man fared sumptuously every day. He enjoyed all the pleasure
               which wealth and luxury could afford. Luke 16.

   3. To feed; to be entertained. We fared well; we had a good table, and
   courteous treatment.

   4. To proceed in a train of consequences, good or bad.

   So fares it when with truth falsehood contends.

   5. To happen well or ill; with it impersonally. We shall see how it
   will fare with him.

                                  FARE, n.

   1. The price of passage or going; the sum paid or due, for conveying a
   person by land or water; as the fare for crossing a river, called also
   ferriage; the fare for conveyance in a coach; stage-fare. The price of
   conveyance over the ocean is now usually called the passage, or passage
   money. Fare is never used for the price of conveying goods; this is
   called freight or transportation.

   2. Food; provisions of the table. We lived on coarse fare, or we had
   delicious fare.

   3. The person conveyed in a vehicle. [Not in use in United States.]

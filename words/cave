   CAVE, n. A hollow place in the earth; a subterraneous cavern; a den.
   This may be natural or artificial. The primitive inhabitants of the
   earth, in many countries, lived in caves; and the present inhabitants
   of some parts of the earth, especially in the high northern latitudes,
   occupy caves, particularly in winter.

   Caves were also used for the burial of the dead.

   Bacon applies the word to the ear, the cave of the ear; but this
   application is unusual.

                       CAVE, v.i. To dwell in a cave.

   To cave in, to fall in and leave a hollow, as earth on the side of a

   falling of a quantity of earth, it is said to cave in.

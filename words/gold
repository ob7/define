   GOLD, n.

   1. A precious metal of a bright yellow color, and the most ductile and
   malleable of all the metals. It is the heaviest metal except platina;
   and being a very dense, fixed substance, and not liable to be injured
   by air, it is well fitted to be used as coin, or a representative of
   commodities in commerce. Its ductility and malleability render it the
   most suitable metal for gilding. It is often found native in solid
   masses, as in Hungary and Peru; though generally in combination with
   silver, copper or iron.

   2. Money.

   For me, the gold of France did not seduce--

   3. Something pleasing or valuable; as a heart of gold.

   4. A bright yellow color; as a flower edged with gold.

   5. Riches; wealth.

               Gold of pleasure, a plant of the genus Myagrum.

         GOLD, a. Made of gold; consisting of gold; as a gold chain.

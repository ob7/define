   JURISDIC'TION, n. [L. jurisdictio; jus, juris, law, and dictio, from
   dico, to pronounce.]

   1. The legal power of authority of doing justice in cases of complaint;
   the power of executing the laws and distributing justice. Thus we speak
   of certain suits or actions, or the cognizance of certain crimes being
   within the jurisdiction of a court, that is, within the limits of their
   authority or commission. Inferior courts have jurisdiction of debt and
   trespass, or of smaller offenses; the supreme courts have jurisdiction
   of treason, murder, and other high crimes. Jurisdiction is secular or
   ecclesiastical.

   2. Power of governing or legislating. The legislature of one state can
   exercise no jurisdiction in another.

   3. The power or right of exercising authority. Nations claim exclusive
   jurisdiction on the sea, to the extent of a marine league from the main
   land or shore.

   4. The limit within which power may be exercised.

   Jurisdiction, in its most general sense, is the power to make, declare
   or apply the law; when confined to the judiciary department, it is what
     we denominate the judicial power,the right of administering justice
    through the laws, by the means which the laws have provided for that
   purpose. Jurisdiction, is limited to place or territory, to persons, or
                           to particular subjects.

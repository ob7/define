   CUBEB, n. The small spicy berry of the Piper cubeba, from Java and the
   other E. India isles. It was formerly called, from its short stems,
   Piper caudatum, or tailed pepper. It resembles a grain of pepper, but
   is somewhat longer. In aromatic warmth and pungency, it is far inferior
   to pepper.

   HELIOCENT'RIC, a. [Gr. the sun, and center.]

   The heliocentric place of a planet, is the place of the ecliptic in
   which the planet would appear to a spectator at the center of the sun.

   The heliocentric latitude of a planet, is the inclination of a line
   drawn between the center of the sun and the center of a planet to the
   plane of the ecliptic.

   Helioid parabola, in mathematics, the parabolic spiral, a curve which
   arises from the supposition that the axis of the common Apollonian
   parabola is bent round into the periphery of a circle, and is a line
   then passing through the extremities of the ordinates, which now
   converge towards the center of the said circle.

[1]misdemeanor

   MISDEME'ANOR, n. Ill behavior; evil conduct; fault; mismanagement.

   1. In law, an offense of a less atrocious nature than a crime. Crimes
   and misdemeanors are mere synonymous terms; but in common usage, the
   word crime is made to denote offenses of a deeper and more atrocious
   dye, while small faults and omissions of less consequence are comprised
   under the gentler name of misdemeanors.

   VEND, v.t. [L. vendo.]

   To sell; to transfer a thing and the exclusive right of possessing it,
   to another person for a pecuniary equivalent; as, to vend goods; to
   vend meat and vegetables in market. Vending differs from barter. We
   vend for money; we barter for commodities. Vend is applicable only to
   wares, merchandize, or other small articles, not to lands and
   tenements. We never say, to vend a farm, a lease, or a bond, a right or
   a horse.

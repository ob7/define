[1]abut

   ABUT', v.i. To border upon; to be contiguous to; to meet; in
   strictness, to adjoin to at the end; but this distinction has not
   always been observed. The word is chiefly used in describing the bounds
   or situation of land, and in popular language, is contracted into but,
   as butted and bounded.

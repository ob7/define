[1]maintenance

   MA'INTENANCE, n. Sustenance; sustentation; support by means of supplies
   of food, clothing and other conveniences; as, his labor contributed
   little to the maintenance of his family.

   1. Means of support; that which supplies conveniences.

   Those of better fortune not making learning their maintenance.

   2. Support; protection; defense; vindication; as the maintenance of
   right or just claims.

   3. Continuance; security from failure or decline.

   Whatever is granted to the church for God's honor and the maintenance
   of his service, is granted to God.

   4. In law, an officious intermeddling in a suit in which the person has
   no interest, by assisting either party with money or means to prosecute
   or defend it. This is a punishable offense. But to assist a poor
   kinsman from compassion, is not maintenance.

[1]wilt

   WILT, v.i. [G., to fade; that is, to shrink or withdraw.] To begin to
   wither; to lose freshness and become flaccid, as a plant when exposed
   to great heat in a dry day, or when first separated from its root. This
   is a legitimate word, for which there is no substitute in the language.
   It is not synonymous with wither, as it expresses only the beginning of
   withering. A wilted plant often revives and becomes fresh; not so a
   withered plant.

   WILT, v.t.

   1. To cause to begin to wither; to make flaccid; as a green plant.

   2. To cause to languish; to depress or destroy the vigor and energy of.

   Despots have wilted the human race into sloth and imbecility.

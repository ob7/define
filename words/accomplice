[1]accomplice

   ACCOM'PLICE, n. [L. complicatus, folded together, of con, with, and
   plico, to fold. See Complex and Pledge.] An associate in a crime; a
   partner or partaker in guilt. It was formerly used in a good sense for
   a co-operator, but this sense is wholly obsolete. It is followed by
   with before a person; as A was an accomplice with B in the murder of C.
   Dryden uses it with to before a thing.

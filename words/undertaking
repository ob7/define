   UNDERTA'KING, n. Any business, work or project which a person engages
   in, or attempts to perform; an enterprise. The canal, or the making of
   the canal, from the Hudson to lake Erie, a distance of almost four
   hundred miles, was the greatest undertaking of the kind in modern
   times. The attempt to find a navigable passage to the Pacific round
   North America, is a hazardous undertaking, and probably useless to
   navigation.

   AN'ISE, n. an'nis. [L. anisum; Gr.]

   An annual plant, placed by Linne under the genus Pimpinella. It grows
   naturally in Egypt, and is cultivated in Spain and Malta, whence the
   seeds are imported. The stalk rises a foot and a half high, dividing
   into slender branches, garnished with narrow leaves, cut into three or
   four narrow segments. The branches terminate in large loose umbels,
   composed of smaller umbels or rays, on long footstalks. The flowers are
   small and of a yellowish white; the seeds oblong and swelling. Anise
   seeds have an aromatic smell, and a pleasant warm taste; they are
   useful in warming the stomach and expelling wind.

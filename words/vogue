   VOGUE, n. vig. [The sense of vogue is way, or the going of the world.]

   The way or fashion of people at any particular time; temporary mode,
   custom or practice; popular reception for the time. We say, a
   particular form of dress is now in vogue; an amusing writer is now in
   vogue; such opinions are now in vogue. The phrase, the vogue of the
   world, used by good writers formerly, is nearly or quite obsolete.

   Use may revive the obsoletest word, and banish those that now are most
   in vogue.

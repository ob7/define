   only in our system of planets.

   2. Indefinitely, some or any. You will one day repent of your folly.
   But in this phrase, one day is equivalent to some future time.

   3. It follows any.

   When any one heareth the word of the kingdom. Matt. 13.

   4. Different; diverse; opposed to another. It is one thing to promise,
   and another to fulfill.

   5. It is used with another, to denote mutuality or reciprocation. Be
   kind and assist one another.

   6. It is used with another, to denote average or mean proportion. The
   coins one with another, weigh seven penny weight each.

   No. 2.]

   At one, in union; in agreement or concord.

   In one, in union; in one united body.

   One, like many other adjectives is used without a noun, and is to be
   considered as a substitute for some noun understood. Let the men depart
   one by one; count them one by one; every one has his peculiar habits;
   we learn of one another, that is, we learn, one of us learns of
   another.

   In this use, as a substitute, one may be plural; as the great ones of
   the earth; they came with their little ones.

   It also denotes union, a united body.

   Ye are all one in Christ Jesus. Gal 3.

   One o'clock, one hour of the clock that is, as signified or represented
   by the clock.

   One is used indefinitely for any person; as, one sees; one knows; after
   the French manner, on voit. Our ancestors used man in this manner; man
   sees; man knows; "man brohte," man brought, that is, they brought.

   This word we have received from the Latin through the Italian and
   French. The same word from our Saxon ancestors we write an.

   REP'UTABLE, a. [from repute.]

   1. Being in good repute; held in esteem; as a reputable man or
   character; reputable conduct. It expresses less than respectable and
   honorable, denoting the good opinion of men, without distinction or
   great qualities.

   2. Consistent with reputation; not mean or disgraceful. It is evidence
   of extreme depravity that vice is in any case reputable.

   In the article of danger, it is as reputable to elude an enemy as to
   defeat one.

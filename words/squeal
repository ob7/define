[1]squeal

   SQUEAL, v.i. [See Squall.] To cry with a sharp shrill voice. It is used
   of animals only, and chiefly of swine. It agrees in sense with squeak,
   except that squeal denotes a more continues cry than squeak, and the
   latter is not limited to animals. We say, a squealing hog or pig, a
   squealing child; but more generally a squalling child.

[1]centripetal

   CENTRIPETAL, a. Tending towards the center. Centripetal force is that
   force which draws or impels a body towards some point as a center; as
   in case of a planet revolving round the sun, the center of the system.
   [Note: The common accentuation of centrifugal and centripetal is
   artificial and harsh. The accent on the first and third syllables, as
   in circumpolar, would be natural and easy.]

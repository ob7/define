   CLOVER-GRASS, n. A genus of plants, called Trifolium, trefoil, or
   three-leafed, Fr. trefle. The species are numerous. The red clover is
   generally cultivated for fodder and for enriching land. The white
   clover is also excellent food for cattle, either green or dry, and from
   its flowers the bee collects no small portion of its stores of honey.

   To live in clover, is to live luxuriously, or in abundance; a phrase
   borrowed from the luxuriant growth of clover, and the feeding of cattle
   in clover.

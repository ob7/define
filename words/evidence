   EV'IDENCE, n. [L. evidentia, from video, to see.]

   1. That which elucidates and enables the mind to see truth; proof
   arising from our own perceptions by the senses, or from the testimony
   of others, or from inductions of reason. Our senses furnish evidence of
   the existence of matter, of solidity, of color, of heat and cold, of a
   difference in the qualities of bodies, of figure , &c. The declarations
   of a witness furnish evidence of facts to a court and jury; and
   reasoning, or the deductions of the mind from facts or arguments,
   furnish evidence of truth or falsehood.

   2. Any instrument or writing which contains proof.

   I delivered the evidence of the purchase to Baruch. Jer.32.

   I subscribed the evidence and sealed it. Jer.32.

   3. A witness; one who testifies to a fact. This sense is improper and
   inelegant, though common, and found even in Johnson's writings.

    EV'IDENCE, v.t. To elucidate; to prove; to make clear to the mind; to
    show in such a manner that the mind can apprehend the truth, or in a
      manner to convince it. The testimony of two witnesses is usually
   sufficient to evidence the guilt of an offender. The works of creation
         clearly evidence the existence of an infinite first cause.

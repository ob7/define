   IMPLIC'IT, a. [L. implicitus, from implico, supra.]

   1. Infolded; entangled; complicated.

   In his woolly fleece

   I cling implicit. [Little used.]

   2. Implied; tacitly comprised; fairly to be understood, though not
   expressed in words; as an implicit contract or agreement.

   3. Resting on another; trusting to the word or authority of another,
   without doubting or reserve, or without examining into the truth of the
   thing itself. Thus we give implicit credit or confidence to the
   declarations of a person of known veracity. We receive with implicit
   faith whatever God has clearly revealed.

   RACOON', n. An American quadruped of the genus Ursus. It is somewhat
   larger than a fox, and its fur is deemed valuable, next to that of the
   beaver. This animal lodges in a hollow tree, feeds on vegetables, and
   its flesh is palatable food. It inhabits North America from Canada to
   the tropics.

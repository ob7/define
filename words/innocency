[1]innocency

   IN'NOCENCY, n. [L. innocentia; in and noceo, to hurt.]

   1. Properly, freedom from any quality that can injure; innoxiousness;
   harmlessness; as the innocence of a medicine which can do no harm. In
   this sense, the noun is not obsolete, though less used than the
   adjective.

   2. In a moral sense, freedom from crime, sin or guilt; untainted purity
   of heart and life; unimpaired integrity.

   Enjoyment left nothing to ask--innocence left nothing to fear.

   3. Freedom from guilt or evil intentions; simplicity of heart; as the
   innocence of a child.

   4. Freedom from the guilt of a particular sin or crime. This is the
   sense in which the word is most generally used, for perfect innocence
   cannot be predicated of man. A man charged with theft or murder may
   prove his innocence.

   5. The state of being lawfully conveyed to a belligerent, or of not
   being contraband; as the innocence of a cargo, or of any merchandize.

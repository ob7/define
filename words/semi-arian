   SEMI-A'RIAN, n. [See Arian.] In ecclesiastical history, the Semi-arians
   were a branch of the Arians, who in appearance condemned the errors of
   Arius, but acquiesced in some of his principles, disguising them under
   more moderate terms. they did not acknowledge the Son to be
   consubstantial with the Father, that is, of the same substance, but
   admitted him to be of a like substance with the Father, not by nature,
   but by a peculiar priviledge.

   SEMI-A'RIAN, a. Pertaining to semi-arianism.

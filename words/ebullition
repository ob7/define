[1]ebullition

   EBULLI'TION, n. [L. ebullitio, from ebullio, bullio; Eng. to boil,which
   see.]

   1. The operation of boiling; the agitation of a liquor by heat, which
   throws it up in bubbles, or more properly, the agitation produced in a
   fluid by the escape of a portion of it, converted into an aeriform
   state by heat. Ebullition is produced by the heat of fire directly
   applied, or by the heat or caloric evolved by any substance in mixture.
   Thus, in slaking lime, the caloric set at liberty by the a absorption
   of water, produces ebullition.

   2. Effervescence, which is occasioned by fermentation, or by any other
   process which causes the extrication of an aeriform fluid, as in the
   mixture of an acid with a carbonated alkali.

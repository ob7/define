[1]glove

   GLOVE, n. A cover for the hand, or for the hand and arm, with a
   separate sheath for each finger. The latter circumstance distinguishes
   the glove from the mitten.

   To throw the glove, with our ancestors, was to challenge to single
   combat.

   GLOVE, v.t. To cover with a glove.

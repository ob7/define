   SUGAR, n. SHUG'AR. [L. saccharum.]

   1. A well known substance manufactured chiefly from the sugar cane,
   arundo saccharifera; but in the United States, great quantities of this
   article are made from the sugar maple; and in France, a few years
   since, it was extensively manufactured from the beet. The saccharine
   liquor is concentrated by boiling, which expels the water; lime is
   added to neutralize the acid that is usually present; the gresser
   impurities rise to the surface, and are separated in the form of scum;
   and finally as the liquor cools,the sugar separates from the melasses
   in grains. The sirup or melasses is drained off, leaving the sugar in
   the state known in commerce by the name of raw or muscovado sugar. This
   is farther purified by means of clay, or more extensively by bullocks'
   blood, which forming a coagulum, envelops the impurities. Thus
   clarified, it takes the names of lump, loaf, refined, &c. according to
   the different degrees of purification. Sugar is a proximate element of
   the vegetable kingdom, and is found in most ripe fruits and many
   farinaceous roots. By fermentation, sugar is converted into alcohol,
   and hence forms the basis of those substances which are used for making
   intoxicating liquors, as melasses, grapes, apples, malt, &c.

   The ultimate elements of sugar are oxygen, carbon and hydrogen. Of all
   vegetable principles, it is considered by Dr. Rush as the most
   wholesome and nutritious.

   2. A chimical term; as the sugar of lead.

[1]right

   RIGHT, a. rite. [L. rectus, from the root of rego, properly to strain
   or stretch, whence straight.]

   Properly; strained; stretched to straightness; hence,

   1. Straight. A right line in geometry is the shortest line that can be
   drawn or imagined between two points. A right line may be horizontal,
   perpendicular, or inclined to the plane of the horizon.

   2. In morals and religion, just; equitable; accordant to the standard
   of truth and justice or the will of God. That alone is right in the
   sight of God, which is consonant to his will or law; this being the
   only perfect standard of truth and justice. In social and political
   affairs, that is right which is consonant to the laws and customs of a
   country, provided these laws and customs are not repugnant to the laws
   of God. A man's intentions may be right, though his actions may be
   wrong in consequence of a defect in judgment.

   3. Fit; suitable; proper; becoming. In things indifferent, or which are
   regulated by no positive law, that is right which is best suited to the
   character, occasion or purpose, or which is fitted to produce some good
   effect. It is right for a rich man to dress himself and his family in
   expensive clothing, which it would not be right for a poor man to
   purchase. It is right for every man to choose his own time for eating
   or exercise.

   Right is a relative term; what may be right for one end, may be wrong
   for another.

   4. Lawful; as the right heir of an estate.

   5. True; not erroneous or wrong; according to fact.

   If there be no prospect beyond the grave, the inference is certainly
   right, "let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."

   6. Correct; passing a true judgment; not mistaken or wrong.

   You are right, justice, and you weigh this well.

   7. Not left; most convenient or dextrous; as the right hand, which is
   generally most strong or most convenient in use.

   8. Most favorable or convenient.

   The lady has been disappointed on the right side.

   9. Properly placed, disposed or adjusted; orderly; well regulated.

   10. Well performed, as an art or act.

   11. Most direct; as the right way from London to Oxford.

   12. Being on the same side as the right hand; as the right side.

   13. Being on the right hand of a person whose face is towards the mouth
   of a river; as the right bank of the Hudson.

                                 RIGHT, adv.

   1. In a right or straight line; directly.

   Let thine eyes look right on. Prov. 4.

   2. According to the law or will of God, or to the standard of truth and
   justice; as, to judge right.

   3. According to any rule of art.

   You with strict discipline instructed right.

   4. According to fact or truth; as, to tell a story right.

   5. In a great degree; very; as right humble; right noble; right
   valiant. [Obsolescent or inelegant.]

   6. It is prefixed to titles; as in right honorable; right reverend.

   RIGHT, is used elliptically for it is right, what you say is right, it
                                is true, &c.

   Right, cries his lordship.

   On the right, on the side with the right hand.

                                  RIGHT, n.

   1. Conformity to the will of God, or to his law, the perfect standard
   of truth and justice. In the literal sense, right is a straight line of
   conduct, and wrong a crooked one. Right therefore is rectitude or
   straightness, and perfect rectitude is found only in an infinite Being
   and his will.

   2. Conformity to human laws, or to other human standard of truth,
   propriety or justice. When laws are definite, right and wrong are
   easily ascertained and understood. In arts, there are some principles
   and rules which determine what is right. In many things indifferent, or
   left without positive law, we are to judge what is right by fitness or
   propriety, by custom, civility or other circumstances.

   3. Justice; that which is due or proper; as, to do right to every man.

   Long love to her has borne the faithful knight, and well deserv'd had
   fortune done him right.

   4. Freedom from error; conformity with truth or fact.

   Seldom your opinions err, your eyes are always in the right.

   5. Just claim; legal title; ownership; the legal power of exclusive
   possession and enjoyment. In hereditary monarchies, a right to the
   throne vests in the heir on the decease of the king. A deed vests the
   right of possession in the purchaser of land. Right and possession are
   very different things. We often have occasion to demand and sue for
   rights not in possession.

   6. Just claim by courtesy, customs, or the principles of civility and
   decorum. Every man has a right to civil treatment. The magistrate has a
   right to respect.

   7. Just claim by sovereignty; prerogative. God, as the author of all
   things, has a right to govern and dispose of them at his pleasure.

   8. That which justly belongs to one.

   Born free, he sought his right.

   9. Property; interest.

   A subject in his prince may claim a right.

   10. Just claim; immunity; privilege. All men have a right to the secure
   enjoyment of life, personal safety, liberty and property. We deem the
   right of trial by jury invaluable, particularly in the case of crimes.
   Rights are natural, civil, political, religious, personal, and public.

   11. Authority; legal power. We have no right to disturb others in the
   enjoyment of their religious opinions.

   12. In the United States, a tract of land; or a share or proportion of
   property, as in a mine or manufactory.

   13. The side opposite to the left; as on the right. Look to the right.

   1. To rights, in a direct line; straight. [Unusual.]

   To put to rights, to put into good order; to adjust; to regulate what
   is out of order.

[1]ebony

   EB'ONY, n. [L. ebenus.] A species of hard,heavy and durable wood, which
   admits of a fine polish or gloss; said to be brought from Madagascar.
   The most usual color is black, red or green. The best is a jet black,
   free from veins and rind, very heavy, astringent and of an acrid
   pungent taste. On burning coals it yields an agreeable perfume, and
   when green it readily takes fire from its abundance of fat. It is
   wrought into toys, and used for mosaic and inlaid work.

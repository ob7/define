[1]rather

   RATH'ER, adv. [I would rather go, or sooner go. The use is taken from
   pushing or moving forward.] [L. ante, before.] But he said, yea rather,
   happy are they that hear the word of God and keep it. Luke 11.]

   1. More readily or willingly; with better liking; with preference or
   choice.

   My soul chooseth strangling and death rather than life. Job. 7.

   Light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light,
   because their deeds were evil. John 3. Ps. 84.

   2. In preference; preferably; with better reason. Good is rather to be
   chosen than evil. See acts 5.

   3. In a greater degree than otherwise.

   He sought throughout the world, but sought in vain, and no where
   finding, rather fear'd her slain.

   4. More properly; more correctly speaking.

   This is an art which does mend nature, change it rather; but the art
   itself is nature.

   5. Noting some degree of contrariety in fact.

   She was nothing better, but rather grew worse. Mark 5.

                                  Matt. 27.

   The rather, especially; for better reason; for particular cause.

   You are come to me in a happy time, the rather for I have some sport in
   hand.

   Had rather, is supposed to be a corruption of would rather.

   I had rather speak five words with my understanding -

                                  1Cor. 14.

   This phrase may have been originally, "I'd rather," for I would rather,
   and the contraction afterwards mistaken for had. Correct speakers and
   writers generally use would in all such phrases; I would rather, I
   prefer; I desire in preference.

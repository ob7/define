[1]fowl

   FOWL, n. [L. fugio, fugo, Gr. and signifying the flying animal.]

   A flying or winged animal; the generic name of certain animals that
   move through the air by the aid of wings. Fowls have two feet, are
   covered with feathers, and have wings for flight. Bird is a young fowl
   or chicken, and may well be applied to the smaller species of fowls.
   But it has usurped the place of fowl, and is used improperly as the
   generic term.

   Fowl is used as a collective noun. We dined on fish and fowl.

   Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of
   the air. Gen. 1.

   But this use in America is not frequent. We generally use the plural,
   fowls. The word is colloquially used for poultry, or rather, in a more
   limited sense, for barn door fowls.

   FOWL, v.i. To catch or kill wild fowls for game or food; as by means of
   bird-lime, decoys, nets and snares, or by pursuing them with hawks, or
                                by shooting.

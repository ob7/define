   1. To transfer property or the exclusive right of possession to another
   for an equivalent in money. It is correlative to buy, as one party buys
   what the other sells. It is distinguished from exchange or barter, in
   which one commodity is given for another; wheras in selling the
   consideration is money, or its representative in current notes. To this
   distinction there may be certain exceptions. "Esau sold his birthright
   to Jacob for a mess of pottage." But this is unusual. "Let us sell
   Joseph to the Ishmaelites- And they sold him for twenty pieces of
   silver." Gen. 37.

   Among the Hebrews, parents had power to sell their children.

   2. To betray; to deliver or surrender for money or reward; as, to sell
   one's country.

   3. To yield or give for a certain consideration. the troops fought like
   lions, and sold their lives dearly. that is, they yielded their lives,
   but first destroyed many, which made it a dear purchase for their
   enemies.

   4. In Scripture, to give up to be harassed and made slaves.

   He sold them into the hands of their enemies. Judg. 2.

   5. To part with; to renounce or forsake.

   Buy the truth and sell it not. Prov. 23.

[1]luncheon

   LUNCH'EON, n.

   Literally, a swallow; but in usage, a portion of food taken at any
   time, except at a regular meal. It is not unusual to take a luncheon
   before dinner. The passengers in the line-ships regularly have their
   lunch.

   I sliced the luncheon from the barley loaf.

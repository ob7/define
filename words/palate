[1]palate

   PAL'ATE, n. [L. palatum, properly the arch or cope of heaven.]

   1. The roof or upper part of the mouth. The glands in this part of the
   mouth secrete a mucous fluid, which lubricates the mouth and throat,
   and facilitates deglutition.

   2. Taste.

   Hard task to hit the palates of such guests.

   [This signification of the word originated in the opinion that the
   palate is the instrument of taste. This is a mistake. In itself it has
   no power of taste.]

   3. Mental relish; intellectual taste.

   Men of nice palates could not relish Aristotle, as dressed up by the
   schoolmen.

             PAL'ATE, v.t. To perceive by the taste. [Not used.]

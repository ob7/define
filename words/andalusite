   AN'DALUSITE, n. A massive mineral, of a flesh or rose red color;
   sometimes found crystallized in imperfect four-sided prisms, nearly or
   quite rectangular. Its hardness is nearly equal to that of Corundum,
   and it is infusible by the blow pipe. It has its name from Andalusia,
   in Spain, where it was first discovered.

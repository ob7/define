[1]popularity

   POPULAR'ITY, n. [L. popularitas.] Favor of the people; the state of
   possessing the affections and confidence of the people in general; as
   the popularity of the ministry; the popularity of a public officer or
   of a preacher. It is applied also to things; as the popularity of a law
   or public measure; the popularity of a book or poem. The most valuable
   trait in a patriot's character is to forbear all improper compliances
   for gaining popularity.

   I have long since learned the little value which is to be placed in
   popularity, acquired by any other way than virtue; I have also learned
   that it is often obtained by other means.

   The man whose ruling principle is duty--is never perplexed with anxious
   corroding calculations of interest and popularity.

   1. Representation suited to vulgar or common conception; that which is
   intended or adapted to procure the favor of the people. [Little used.]

   TAN'TALIZE, v.t. [from Tantalus, in fable, who was condemned for his
   crimes to perpetual hunger and thirst, with food and water near him
   which he could not reach.]

   To tease or torment by presenting some good to the view and exciting
   desire, but continually frustrating the expectations by keeping that
   good out of reach; to tease; to torment.

   Thy vain desires, at strife

   Within themselves, have tantaliz'd thy life.

[1]wampum

   WAMPUM, n. Shells or strings of shells, used by the American Indians as
   money or a medium of commerce. These strings of shells when united,
   form a broad belt, which is worn as an ornament or girdle. It is
   sometimes called wampumpeague, and wompeague, or wampampeague, of which
   wampum seems to be a contraction.

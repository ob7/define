   1. To thrust in or on; to throw, crowd or thrust into any place or
   state by force or imposition, or without solicitation. Men obtrude
   their vain speculations upon the world.

   A cause of common error is the credulity of men, that is, an easy
   assent to what is obtruded.

   The objects of our senses obtrude their particular ideas upon our
   minds, whether we will or not.

   2. To offer with unreasonable importunity; to urge upon against the
   will.

   Why shouldst thou then obtrude this diligence in vain, where no
   acceptance it can find?

   thrust one's self in uninvited, or against the will of the company.

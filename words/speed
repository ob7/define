   SPEED, v.i. pret. and pp. sped, speeded. [The L. expedio may be from
   the same root, which signifies to drive, to hurry, of the family of L.
   peto.]

   1. To make haste; to move with celerity.

   2. To have success; to prosper; to succeed; that is, to advance in
   one's enterprise. He that's once demi'd will hardly speed. Those that
   profaned and abused the second temple, sped no better.

   3. To have any condition good or ill; to fare. Ships heretofore in seas
   like fishes sped, The mightiest still upon the smallest fed.

                                 SPEED, v.t.

   1. TO dispatch; to send away in haste. He sped him thence home to his
   habitation.

   2. To hasten; to hurry; to put in quick motion. -But sped his steps
   along the hoarse resounding shore.

   3. TO hasten to a conclusion; to execute; to dispatch; as, to speed
   judicial acts.

   4. To assist; to help forward; to hasten. -With rising gales that sped
   their happy flight.

   5. To prosper; to cause to succeed. May heaven speed this undertaking.

   6. To furnish in haste.

   7. To dispatch; to kill; to ruin; to destroy. With a speeding thrust
   his heart he found. A dire dilemma! either way I'm sped; If foes, they
   write if friends they read me dead.

    Note In the phrase, "God speed," there is probably a gross mistake in
    considering it as equivalent to "may God give you success." The true
    phrase is probably "good speed; good, in Saxon, being written god. I
           bid you or wish you good speed, that is, good success.

                                  SPEED, n.

   1. Swiftness; quickness; celerity; applied to animals. We say, a man or
   a horse runs or travels with speed; a fowl flies with speed. We speak
   of the speed of a fish in the water, but we do not speak of the speed
   of a river, or of wind, or of a falling body. I think however I have
   seen the word applied to the lapse of time and the motion of lightning,
   but in poetry only.

   2. Haste; dispatch; as, to perform a journey with speed; to execute an
   order with speed.

   3. Rapid pace; as a horse of speed. We say also, high speed, full
   speed.

   4. Success; prosperity in an undertaking; favorable issue; that is,
   advance to the desired end. O Lord God of my master Abraham, I pray
   thee, send me good speed this day. Gen. 24. This use is retained in the
   proverb, "to make more haste than good speed," and in the Scriptural
   phrase, "to bid one good speed," [Not God speed, as erroneously
   written.]

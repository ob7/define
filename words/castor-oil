[1]castor-oil

   CASTOR-OIL, n. The oil of the Ricinus, or Palma Christi, a plant of the
   West Indies, which grows to the highth of twenty feet, in one season.
   The oil is obtained from the nuts or seeds by expression or decoction.
   That obtained by decoction is preferred, as less liable to become
   rancid, being free from the mucilage and acrid matter, which is mixed
   with the oil when expressed. It is a mild cathartic.

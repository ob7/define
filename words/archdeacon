   ARCHDE'ACON, n. [See Deacon.]

   In England, an ecclesiastical dignitary, next in rank below a bishop,
   who has jurisdiction either over a part or over the whole diocese. He
   is usually appointed by the bishop, and has an authority originally
   derived from the bishop, but now independent of him. He has a court,
   the most inferior of ecclesiastical courts, for hearing ecclesiastical
   causes, and the punishment of offenders by spiritual censures.

   BLOW-PIPE, , n. [blow and pipe.] An instrument by which a blast or
   current of air is driven through the flame of a lamp or candle,and that
   flame directed upon a mineral substance, to fuse or vitrify it.

   Blow-pipe of the artist, a conical tube of brass, glass or other
   substance, usually a quarter of an inch in diameter at one end, and
   capillary or nearly so at the other, where it is bent nearly to a right
   angle. This is used to propel a jet of air from the lungs, through the
   flame of a lamp or candle, upon substance to be fused.

   Blow-pipe of the mineralogist, the same instrument substantially as the
   foregoing, but usually fitted with an ivory or silver mouth-piece, and
   with several movable jets to produce flames of different sizes. Its
   office is to produce instantly a furnace heat, on minute fragments of
   mineral substances, supported on charcoal, by platina forceps. &c.

   Compound Blow-pipe of Dr. Hare, invented in 1821, an instrument in
   which oxygen and hydrogen,propelled by hydrostatic or other pressure,
   coming from separate reservoirs,in the proportions requisite to form
   water, are made to unite in a capillary orifice, at the moment when
   they are kindled. The heat produced, when the focus is formed on
   charcoal or any non-conducting substance, is such as to melt every
   thing but the diamond, to burn the metals, and to dissipate in vapor,
   or in gaseous forms, most known substances.

   The blow-pipe of Newman, Clark, &c. is the compound blow-pipe of Dr.
   Hare, with some unimportant modifications.

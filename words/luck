   LUCK, n.

   That which happens to a person; an event, good or ill, affecting a
   man's interest or happiness, and which is deemed casual; fortune. Luck
   respects persons and their proceedings. We never say, in a literal
   sense, that a plant has the luck to grow in a particular place; or a
   fossil has the luck to be of a particular form. We say, a person has
   the good luck to escape from danger; or the ill luck to be ensnared or
   to suffer loss. He has had good luck, or bad luck in gaming, fishing or
   hunting. Luck, or what we call chance, accident, fortune, is an event
   which takes place without being intended or foreseen, or from some
   cause not under human control; that which cannot be previously known or
   determined with certainty by human skill or power.

   Consider the gift of luck as below the care of a wise man.

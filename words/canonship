[1]canonship

   CANONSHIP, n. An ecclesiastical benefice, in a cathedral or collegiate
   church, which has a prebend or stated allowance out of the revenues of
   the church commonly annexed to it. The benifice filled by a canon. A
   prebend may subsist without a canonry; but a canonicate is inseparable
   from a prebend.

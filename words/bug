[1]bug

   BUG, n. In common language, the name of a vast multitude of insects,
   which infest houses and plants. In zoology, this word is applied to the
   insects arranged under the genus Cimex, of which several hundred
   species are described. Bugs belong to the order of hemipters. They are
   furnished with a rostrum or beak, with antennae longer than the thorax,
   and the winds are folded together crosswise. The back is flat, the
   throat margined, and the feet are formed for running. Some species have
   no wings. The house-bug, or bed-bug, is a troublesome and disgusting
   insect.

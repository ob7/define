   PROB'ABLE, a. [L. probabilis, from probo, to prove. See Prove.]

   1. Likely; having more evidence than the contrary, or evidence which
   inclines the mind to belief, but leaves some room for doubt.

   That is accounted probable, which has better arguments producible for
   it than can be brought against it.

   I do not say that the principles of religion are merely probable; I
   have before asserted them to be morally certain.

   2. That renders something probable; as probable evidence, or probable
   presumption.

   3. That may be proved. [Not in use.]

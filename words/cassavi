   CASSAVI, n. A plant, of the genus Jatropha, of different species. The
   roots of the manihot or bitter cassada, and of the janipha, are made
   into a kind of bread which serves for food to the natives of Africa and
   the West Indies, and they are also roasted and eaten like potatoes.
   They yield also a great quantity of starch, which the Brasilians export
   in small lumps under the name of tapioca.

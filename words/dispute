   DISPUTE, v.i. [L. Dispute is radically very similar to debate and
   discuss, both of which are from beating, driving, agitation.]

   1. To contend in argument; to reason or argue in opposition; to debate;
   to altercate; and to dispute violently is to wrangle. Paul disputed
   with the Jews int he synagogue. The disciples of Christ disputed among
   themselves who should be the greatest. Men often dispute about trifles.

   2. To strive or contend in opposition in a competitor; as, we disputed
   for the prize.

                                DISPUTE, v.t.

   1. To attempt to disprove by arguments or statements; to attempt to
   prove to be false, unfounded or erroneous; to controvert; to attempt to
   overthrow by reasoning. We dispute assertions, opinions, arguments or
   statements, when we endeavor to prove them false or unfounded. We
   dispute the validity of a title or claim. Hence to dispute a cause or
   case with another, is to endeavor to maintain ones own opinions or
   claims, and to overthrow those of his opponent.

   2. To strive or contend for, either by words or actions; as, to dispute
   the honor of the day; to dispute a prize. But this phrase is
   elliptical, being used for dispute for, and primarily the verb is
   intransitive. See the Intransitive Verb, No. 2.

   3. To call in question the propriety of; to oppose by reasoning. An
   officer is never to dispute the orders of his superior.

   4. To strive to maintain; as, to dispute every inch of ground.

                                 DISPUTE, n.

   1. Strife or contest in words or by arguments; an attempt to prove and
   maintain ones own opinions or claims, by arguments or statements, in
   opposition to the opinions, arguments or claims of another; controversy
   in words. They had a dispute on the lawfulness of slavery, a subject
   which, one would think, could admit of no dispute.

   Dispute is usually applied to verbal contest; controversy may be in
   words or writing.

   Dispute is between individuals; debate and discussion are applicable to
   public bodies.

   2. The possibility of being controverted; as in the phrase, this is a
   fact, beyond all dispute.

[1]clamor

   CLAMOR, n.

   1. A great outcry; noise; exclamation; vociferation, made by a loud
   human voice continued or repeated, or by a multitude of voices. It
   often expresses complaint and urgent demand.

   2. Figuratively, loud and continued noise, as of a river or other
   inanimate things.

                      CLAMOR, v.t. To stun with noise.

   To clamor bells, is to multiply the strokes.

   CLAMOR, v.i. To utter loud sounds, or outcries; to talk loud; to utter
   loud voices repeatedly; to vociferate, as an individual; to utter loud
      voices, as a multitude; to complain; to make importunate demands.

   Those who most loudly clamor for liberty do not most liberally grant
   it.

   Glamor your tongues in Shakespeare, if intended to mean, stop from
   noise, is not English. Perhaps the word was clam, or intended for a
   derivative.

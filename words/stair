   STAIR, n.

   1. A step; a stone or a frame of boards or planks by which a person
   rises one step. A stair, to make the ascent easy, should not exceed six
   or seven inches in elevation. When the riser is eight, nine or ten
   inches in breadth, the ascent by stairs is laborious.

   2. Stairs, in the plural, a series of steps by which persons ascend to
   a higher room in a building. [Stair, in this sense, is not in use.]

   Flight of stairs, may signify the stairs which make the whole ascent of
   a story; or in winding stairs, the phrase may signify the stairs from
   the floor to a turn, or from one turn to another.

[1]misrepresenting

   MISREPRESENT'ING, ppr. Giving a false or erroneous representation.

   [Note. This word is so customarily used for an euphemism, or as a
   softer expression for lie or falsehood, as to convey the idea generally
   of intentional falsehood. This signification however is not necessarily
   implied.]

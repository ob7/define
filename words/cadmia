[1]cadmia

   CADMIA, n. An oxyd of zink which collects on the sides of furnaces
   where zink is sublimed, as in brass founderies. This substance is
   readily volatilized on charcoal, by the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe, and it
   burns with the usual beautiful combustion of zink. Pulverized, mixed
   with charcoal powder, wrapped in sheet copper, and heated with the
   compound blowpipe, it readily forms brass.

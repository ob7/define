[1]analogical

   ANALOG'ICAL, a. Having analogy; used by way of analogy; bearing some
   relation. Thus analogical reasoning is reasoning from some similitude
   which things known bear to things unknown. An analogical word is one
   which carries with it some relation to the original idea. Thus the word
   firm primarily denotes solidity or compactness in a material body; and
   by analogy, when used of the mind, it conveys the idea of qualities
   having a similitude to the solidity of bodies, that is, fixedness or
   immovability.

   COUGH, n. A violent effort of the lungs to throw off offending matter;
   a violent, sometimes involuntary, and sonorous expiration, suddenly
   expelling the air through the glottis. The convulsion of the muscles
   serving for exspiration gives great force to the air, while the
   contraction of the glottis produces the sound. The air forced violently
   carries along with it the phlegm or irritating matter which causes the
   convulsion or effort of the muscles.

   COUGH, v.i. To have the lungs convulsed; to make a violent effort with
   noise to expel the air from the lungs, and evacuate any offending
   matter that irritates the parts or renders respiration difficult.

   COUGH, v.t. To expel from the lungs by a convulsive effort with noise;
   to expectorate; followed by up; as, to cough up phlegm.

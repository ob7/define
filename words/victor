[1]victor

   VIC'TOR, n. [L. from vinco, victus, to conquer, or the same root.]

   1. One who conquers in war; a vanquisher; one who defeats an enemy in
   battle. Victor differs from conqueror. We apply conqueror to one who
   subdues countries, kingdoms or nations; as, Alexander was the conqueror
   of Asia or India, or of many nations, or of the world. In such phrases,
   we cannot substitute victor. But we use victor, when we speak of one
   who overcomes a particular enemy, or in a particular battle; as, Cesar
   was victor at Pharsalia. The duke of Wellington was victor at Waterloo.
   Victor then is not followed by the possessive case; for we do not say,
   Alexander was the victor of Darius, though we say, he was victor at
   Arbela.

   2. One who vanquishes another in private combat or contest; as a victor
   in the Olympic games.

   3. One who wins, or gains the advantage.

   In love, the victors from the vanquish'd fly;

   They fly that wound, and they pursue that die.

   4. Master; lord.

   These, victor of his health, his fortune, friends. [Not usual nor
   legitimate.]

   ANOT'TA, n. An elegant red color, formed from the pellicles or pulp of
   the seeds of the bixa, a tree common in South America. This is called
   also Terra Orleana and Roco. The annotta is made by steeping the seeds
   for seven or eight days, pounding them to separate the red skins, then
   straining the liquor, boiling it, taking off the scum which is the
   coloring matter, then boiling it to a due consistence, and making it
   into balls.

[1]herewith

   HEREWITH', adv. With this.

   Most of the compounds of here and a preposition, are obsolete or
   obsolescent, or at least are deemed inelegant. But hereafter and
   heretofore are in elegant use. Herein and hereby are frequently used in
   the present version of the Scriptures, and ought not perhaps to be
   discarded. Indeed some of these words seem to be almost indispensable
   in technical law language.

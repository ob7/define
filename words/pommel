[1]pommel

   POMMEL, n. [L. pomum, an apple, or a similar fruit.]

   1. A knob or ball. 2 Chron. 4.

   2. The knob on the hilt of a sword; the protuberant part of a
   saddle-bow; the round knob on the frame of a chair, &c.

    POMMEL, v.t. [from the noun.] To beat as with a pommel, that is, with
                    something thick or bulky; to bruise.

   [The French se pommeler, to grow dapple, to curdle, is from the same
   source; but the sense is to make knobs or lumps, and hence to
   variegate, or make spots like knobs. The Welsh have from the same root,
   or pwmp,a mass, pwmpiaw, to form a round mass, and to thump, to bang,
   Eng. to bump.]

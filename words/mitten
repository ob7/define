[1]mitten

   MIT'TEN, n.

   1. A cover for the hand, worn to defend it from cold or other injury.
   It differs from a glove, in not having a separate cover for each
   finger.

   2. A cover for the arm only.

      To handle without mittens, to treat roughly; a popular colloquial
                                   phrase.

   REPEA'LABLE, a. Capable of being repealed; revocable by the same power
   that enacted. It is held as a sound principle, that charters or grants
   which vest rights in individuals or corporations, are not repealable
   without the consent of the grantees, unless a clause reserving the
   right is inserted in the act.

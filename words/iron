   IRON, n. i'urn, or i'rn. [L. ferrum, for herrum. The radical elements
   of this word are not easily ascertained.]

   1. A metal, the hardest, most common and most useful of all the metals;
   of a livid whitish color inclined to gray, internally composed, to
   appearance, of small facets, and susceptible of a fine polish. It is so
   hard and elastic as to be capable of destroying the aggregation of any
   other metal. Next to tin, it is the lightest of all metallic
   substances, and next to gold, the most tenacious. It may be hammered
   into plates,but not into leaves. Its ductility is more considerable. It
   has the property of magnetism; it is attracted by the lodestone, and
   will acquire its properties. It is found rarely in native masses, but
   in ores, mineralized by different substances, it abounds in every part
   of the earth. Its medicinal qualities are valuable.

   2. An instrument or utensil made of iron; as a flat-iron, a
   smoothing-iron.

   Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? Job.41.

   3. Figuratively, strength; power; as a rod of iron. Dan.2.

   4. Irons, plu. fetters; chains; manacles; handcuffs. Ps.105.

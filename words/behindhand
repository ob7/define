[1]behindhand

   BEHINDHAND, a. [behind and hand.] In arrear; in an exhausted state; in
   a state in which rent or profit has been anticipated, and expenditures
   precede the receipt of funds to supply them. In popular use, a state of
   poverty, in which the means of living are not adequate to the end.
   Also, in a state of backwardness, in which a particular business has
   been delayed beyond the proper season for performing it; as, he is
   behindhand in his business.

   Behindhand with, is behind in progress; not upon equal terms in
   forwardness; as to be behindhand with the fashionable world.

   This word is really an adjective, as it is applied to the person rather
   than to the verb; but like adrift,aloft, ashamed, and several other
   words, never precedes the noun. Shakespeare's "behindhand slackness."
   therefore, according to present usage, is not a legitimate phrase.

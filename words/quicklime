   QUICK'LIME, n. [See Lime.] Any calcarious substance deprived of its
   fixed or carbonic air, or an earthy substance calcined; as chalk,
   limestone, oyster-shells, &c.; unslaked lime. Calcarious stones and
   shells are reduced to quicklime by being subjected for a considerable
   time to intense heat, which expels the carbonic and aqeuous matter.

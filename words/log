[1]log

   LOG, n.

   1. A bulky piece or stick of timer unhewed. Pine logs are floated down
   rivers in America, and stopped at saw-mills. A piece of timber when
   hewed or squared, is not called a log, unless perhaps in constructing
   log-huts.

   2. In navigation, a machine for measuring the rate of a ship's velocity
   through the water. The common log is a piece of board, forming the
   quadrant of a circle of about six inches radius, balanced by a small
   plate of lead nailed on the circular part, so as to swim perpendicular.

   3. [Heb.] A Hebrew measure of liquids, containing, according to some
   authors, three quarters of a pint; according to others, five sixths of
   a pint. According to Arbuthnot, it was the seventy second part of the
   bath or ephab, and the twelfth part of a hin.

                  LOG, v.i. To move to and fro. [Not used.]

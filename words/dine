[1]dine

   DINE, v.i. [L., to cease. Gr., to feast.] To eat the chief meal of the
   day. This meal seems originally to have been taken about the middle of
   the day, at least in northern climates, as it still is by laboring
   people. Among people in the higher walks of life, and in commercial
   towns, the time of dining is from tow to five or six oclock in the
   afternoon.

   DINE, v.t. To give a dinner to; to furnish with the principal meal; to
   feed; as, the landlord dined a hundred men.

   BOSS'AGE, n.

   1. A stone in a building which has a projecture, and is laid rough, to
   be afterwards carved into moldings, capitals, coats of arms, &c.

   2. Rustic work, consisting of stones which advance beyond the naked or
   level of the building, by reason of indentures or channels left in the
   joinings; chiefly in the corners of edifices, and called rustic quoins.
   The cavities are sometimes round, sometimes beveled or in a diamond
   form, sometimes inclosed with a cavetto, and sometimes with a listel.

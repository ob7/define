[1]potato

   POTA'TO, n. A plant and esculent root of the genus Solanum, a native of
   America. The root of this plant, which is usually called potatoe,
   constitutes one of the cheapest and most nourishing species of
   vegetable food; it is the principal food of the poor in some countries,
   and has often contributed to prevent famine. It was introduced into the
   British dominions by Sir Walter Raleigh or other adventurers in the
   16th century; but is came slowly into use, and at this day is not much
   cultivated and used in some countries of Europe. In the British
   dominions and in the United States, it has proved one of the greatest
   blessings bestowed on man by the Creator.

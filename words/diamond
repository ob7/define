   DIAMOND, n. Dimond. [L., Gr. See Adamant.]

   1. A mineral, gem or precious stone, of the most valuable kind,
   remarkable for its hardness, as it scratches all other minerals. When
   pure, the diamond is usually clear and transparent, but it is sometimes
   colored. In its rough state, it is commonly in the form of a roundish
   pebble, or of octahedral crystals. It consists of carbon, and when
   heated to 14 degrees Wedgewood, and exposed to a current of air, it is
   gradually, but completely combustible. When pure and transparent, it is
   said to be of the first water.

   2. A very small printing letter.

   3. A figure, otherwise called a rhombus.

   DIAMOND, a. Resembling a diamond, as a diamond color; or consisting of
                        diamonds, as a diamond chain.

[1]propolis

   PRO'POLIS, n. [Gr. before the city, or the front of the city.]

   A thick odorous substance having some resemblance to wax and smelling
   like storax; used by bees to stop the holes and crevices in their hives
   to prevent the entrance of cold air, &c. Pliny represents it as the
   third coat; the first he calls commosis; the second pissoceros; the
   third, more solid than the others, he calls propolis.

   This account of the propolis may not be perfectly correct, as authors
   do not agree in their descriptions of it.

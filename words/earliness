[1]earliness

   EARLINESS, n. er'liness. [See Early and Ere.]

   A state of advance or forwardness; a state of being before anything, or
   at the beginning; as the earliness of rising in the morning is a rising
   at the dawn of the morning, or before the usual time of rising. So we
   speak of the earliness of spring, or the earliness of plants, to
   express a state somewhat in advance of the usual time of spring, or
   growth of plants.

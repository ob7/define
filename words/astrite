   AS'TRITE, n. [Gr. a star.]

   An extraneous fossil, called also asteria and astroit. Astrites are
   stones in the form of small, short, angular, or sulcated columns, about
   an inch and a half long, and the third of an inch in diameter, composed
   of several regular joints, which, when separated, resemble a radiated
   star.

   Astrites are said to be detached articulations of encrinites, a kind of
   marine polypier.

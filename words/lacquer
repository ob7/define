[1]lacquer

   LAC'QUER, n. A kind of varnish. The basis of lackers is a solution of
   the substance called seed-lack or shell-lack, in spirit of wine or
   alcohol. Varnishes applied to metals improve their color and preserve
   them from tarnishing.

   Lackers consist of different resins in a state of solution, of which
   the most common are mastick, sandarach, lack, benzoin, copal, amber,
   and asphalt. The menstrua are either expressed or essential oils, or
   spirit of wine.

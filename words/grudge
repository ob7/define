   GRUDGE', v.t. [L. rugio.]

   1. To be discontented at another's enjoyments or advantages; to envy

   To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train.

   employments.

   It is followed by two objects, but probably by ellipsis; as, grudge us
   for grudge to us.

   2. To give or take unwillingly.

   Nor grudge my cold embraces in the grave.

   They have grudged those contributions, which have set our country at
   the head of all the governments of Europe.

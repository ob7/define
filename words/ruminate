   RU'MINATE, v.i. [L. rumino, from rumen, the cud.]

   1. To chew the cud; to chew again what has been slightly chewed and
   swallowed. Oxen, sheep, deer, goats, camels, hares and squirrels
   ruminate in fact; other animals, as moles, bees, crickets, beetles,
   crabs, &c. only appear to ruminate.

   The only animals endowed with the genuine faculty of rumination, are
   the Ruminantia, or cloven-hoofed quadrupeds, but the hare, although its
   stomach is differently organized, is an occasional and partial
   ruminant.

   2. To muse; to meditate; to think again and again; to ponder. It is
   natural to ruminate on misfortunes.

   He practices a slow meditation, and ruminates on the subject.

                               RU'MINATE, v.t.

   1. To chew over again.

   2. To muse on; to meditate over and over again.

   Mad with desire, she ruminates her sin.

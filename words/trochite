   TRO'CHITE, n. [L. trochus; Gr. to run.]

   1. In natural history, a kind of figured fossil stone, resembling parts
   of plants, called St. Cuthbert's beads. These stones are usually of a
   brownish color; they break like spar, and are easily dissolved in
   vinegar. Their figure is generally cylindrical, sometimes a little
   tapering. Two, three or more of these joined, constitute an entrochus.

   2. Fossil remains of the shells called trochus.

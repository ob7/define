   PROBOS'CIS, n. [L. from Gr. before, and to feed or graze.]

   The snout or trunk of an elephant and of other animals, particularly of
   insects. The proboscis of an elephant is a flexible muscular pipe or
   canal of about 8 feet in length, and is properly the extension of the
   nose. This is the instrument with which he takes food and carries it to
   his mouth. The proboscis of insects is used to suck blood from animals,
   or juice from plants.

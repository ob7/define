   PARAM'ETER, n. [ Gr.]

   1. The latus rectum of a parabola. It is a third proportional to the
   abscissa and any ordinate, so that the square of the ordinate is always
   equal to the rectangle under the parameter and abscissa; but in the
   ellipsis and hyperbola it has a different proportion.

   2. In conic sections, a third proportional to any diameter and its
   conjugate. In the parabola, a third proportional to any absciss and its
   ordinate.

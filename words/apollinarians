   APOLLINA'RIANS, in Church history, a sect, deriving their name from
   Apollinaris, bishop of Laodicea, in the 4th Century, who denied the
   proper humanity of Christ; maintaining that his body was endowed with a
   sensitive, and not with a rational soul; and that the divine nature
   supplied the place of the intellectual principle in man.

   Apollo-Belvidere, an ancient statue of the first class in excellence.

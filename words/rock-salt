[1]rock-salt

   ROCK'-SALT, n. Fossil or mineral salt; salt dug from the earth; muriate
   of soda. But in America, this name is sometimes given to salt that
   comes in large crystals from the West Indies, which salt is formed by
   evaporation from sea water, in large basons or cavities, on the isles.
   Hexahedral rock-salt occurs foliated and fibrous.

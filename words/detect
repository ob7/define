   DETECT, v.t. [L., to cover.] Literally, to uncover; hence, to discover;
   to find out; to bring to light; as, to detect the ramifications and
   inosculations of the fine vessels. But this word is especially applied
   to the discovery of secret crimes and artifices. We detect a thief, or
   the crime of stealing. We detect the artifices of the man, or the man
   himself. We detect what is concealed, especially what is concealed by
   design.

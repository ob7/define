[1]bass

   B'ASS, n. [It has no plural.] The name of several species of fish. In
   England, this name is given to a species of perch, called by some the
   sea-wolf, from its voracity, and resembling, in a degree, the trout in
   shape, but having a larger head. It weighs about fifteen pounds. In the
   northern states of America, this name is given to a striped fish which
   grows to the weight of 25 or 30

                                     53

          pounds, and which enters the rivers; the perca ocellata.

     A species of striped fish, of a darker color, with a large head, is
    called sea-bass, as it is never found in fresh water. This fish grows
    to two or three pounds weight. Both species are well tasted, but the
               proper bass is a very white and delicious food.

    B'ASS, n. The linden, lime or tiel tree; called also bass-wood. [See
                                   Bast.]

   2. [pron.bas.] A mat to kneel on in churches.

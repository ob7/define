[1]barnacle

   B'ARNACLE, n. [L.perna, a shell-fish.]

   1. A shell which is often found on the bottoms of ships, rocks and
   timber, below the surface of the sea.

   2. A species of goose, found in the northern seas, but visiting more
   southern climates in winter. The forehead and cheeks are white, but the
   upper part of the body and neck is black. Formerly, a strange notion
   prevailed, that these birds grew out of wood, or rather out of the
   barnacles attached to wood in the sea. Hence the name. It is written
   also Bernacle.

   3. In the plural, an instrument consisting of two branches jointed at
   one end with a hinge, to put upon a horse's nose, to confine him, for
   shoeing, bleeding, or dressing.

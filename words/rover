   RO'VER, n.

   1. A wanderer; one who rambles about.

   2. A fickle or inconstant person.

   3. A robber or pirate; a freebooter. [So corsair is from L. cursus,
   curro, to run.

   At rovers, without any particular aim; at random; as shooting at
   rovers.

   [I never heard this expression in the United States.]

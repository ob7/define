[1]pillage

   PILL'AGE, n.

   1. Plunder; spoil; that which is taken from another by open force,
   particularly and chiefly from enemies in war.

   2. The act of plundering.

   3. In architecture, a square pillar behind a column to bear up the
   arches.

   PILL'AGE, v.t. To strip of money or goods by open violence; as, troops
   pillage the camp or towns of an enemy; to plunder; to spoil. It differs
   from stealing, as it implies open violence,and from robbery, which may
   be committed by one individual on another; whereas pillaging is usually
       the act of bands or numbers. To pillage and to rob are however
                        sometimes used synonymously.

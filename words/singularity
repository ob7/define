   SINGULAR'ITY, n.

   1. Peculiarity; some character or quality of a thing by which it is
   distinguished from all, or from most others. Pliny addeth this
   singularity to that soil, that the second year the very falling of the
   seeds yieldeth corn.

   2. An uncommon character or form; something curious or remarkable. I
   took notice of this little figure for the singularity of the
   instrument.

   3. Particular privilege, prerogative or distinction. No bishop of Rome
   ever took upon him this name of singularity, (universal bishop.)
   Catholicism-must be understood in opposition to the legal singularity
   of the Jewish nation.

   4. Character or trait of character different from that of others;
   peculiarity. The singularity of living according to the strict precepts
   of the gospel is highly to be commended.

   5. Oddity.

   6. Celibacy. [Not in use.]

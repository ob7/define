   ASSETS', n. plu. [L. sat, satis, enough.]

   Goods or estate of a deceased person, sufficient to pay the debts of
   the deceased. But the word sufficient, though expressing the original
   signification of assets, is not with us necessary to the definition. In
   present usage, assets are the money, goods or estate of a deceased
   person, subject by law to the payment of his debts and legacies. Assets
   are real or personal; real assets are lands which descend to the heir,
   subject to the fulfillment of the obligations of the ancestor; personal
   assets are the money or goods of the deceased, or debts due to him,
   which come into the hands of the executor or administrator, or which he
   is bound to collect and convert into money.

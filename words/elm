[1]elm

   ELM, n. [L. ulmus.] A tree of the genus Ulmus. The common elm is one of
   the largest and most majestic trees of the forest, and is cultivated
   for shade and ornament. Another species, the fulva, is called slippery
   elm, from the quality of its inner bark. One species seems to have been
   used to support vines.

   The treaty which William Penn made with the natives in 1682 was
   negotiated under a large Elm which grew on the spot now called
   Kensington, just above Philadelphia. It was prostrated by a storm in
   1810, at which time its stem measured 24 feet in circumference.

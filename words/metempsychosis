   METEMPSYCHO'SIS, n. [Gr. beyond, and animation, life; to animate.]

   Transmigration; the passing of the soul of a man after death into some
   other animal body. Pythagoras and his followers held that after death
   the soul of men pass into other bodies, and this doctrine still
   prevails in some parts of Asia, particularly in India and China.

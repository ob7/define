   CAMLET, n. A stuff originally made of camels hair. It is now made,
   sometimes of wool, sometimes of silk, sometimes of hair, especially
   that of goats, with wool or silk. In some, the warp is silk and wool
   twisted together, and the woof is hair. The pure oriental camlet is
   made solely from the hair of a sort of goat, about Angora. Camlets are
   now make in Europe.

[1]deism

   DEISM, n. [L. God.] The doctrine or creed of a deist; the belief or
   system of religious opinions of those who acknowledge the existence of
   one God, but deny revelation: or deism is the belief in natural
   religion only, or those truths, in doctrine and practice, which man is
   to discover by the light of reason, independent and exclusive of any
   revelation from God. Hence deism implies infidelity or a disbelief in
   the divine origin of the scriptures.

   The view which the rising greatness of our country presents to my eyes,
   is greatly tarnished by the general prevalence of deism, which, with
   me, is but another name for vice and depravity. P. Henry, Wirys
   Sketches.

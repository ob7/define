   NATURE, n. [L. from nature, born, produced,]

   1. In a general sense, whatever is made or produced; a word that
   comprehends all the works of God; the universe. Of a phoenix we say,
   there is no such thing in nature.

   And look through nature up to natures God.

   2. By a metonymy of the effect for the cause, nature is used for the
   agent, creator, author, producer of things, or for the powers that
   produce them. By the expression, trees and fossils are produced by
   nature, we mean, they are formed or produced by certain inherent powers
   in matter, or we mean that they are produced by God, the Creator, the
   Author of whatever is made or produced. The opinion that things are
   produced by inherent powers of matter, independent of a supreme
   intelligent author, is atheism. But generally men mean by nature, thus
   used, the Author of created things, or the operation of his power.

   3. The essence, essential qualities or attributes of a thing, which
   constitute it what it is; as the nature of the soul; the nature of
   blood; the nature of a fluid; the nature of plants, or of a metal; the
   nature of a circle or an angle. When we speak of the nature of man, we
   understand the peculiar constitution of his body or mind, or the
   qualities of the species which distinguish him from other animals. When
   we speak of the nature of a man, or an individual of the race, we mean
   his particular qualities or constitution; either the peculiar
   temperament of his body, or the affections of his mind, his natural
   appetites, passions, disposition or temper. So of irrational animals.

   4. The established or regular course of things; as when we say, an
   event is not according to nature, or it is out of the order of nature.

   5. A law or principle of action or motion in a natural body. A stone by
   nature falls, or inclines to fall.

   6. Constitution aggregate powers of a body, especially a living one. We
   say, nature is strong or weak; nature is almost exhausted.

   7. The constitution and appearances of things.

   The works, whether of poets, painters, moralists or historians, which
   are built upon general nature, live forever.

   8. Natural affection or reverence.

   Have we not seen, the murdering son ascend his parents bed through
   violated nature force his way?

   9. System of created things.

   He binding nature fast in fate, Left conscience free and will.

   10. Sort; species; kind; particular character.

   1. An uneasy sensation in animal bodies, of any degree from slight
   uneasiness to extreme distress or torture, proceeding from pressure,

   of functions. Thus violent pressure or stretching of a limb gives pain;
   inflammation produces pain; wounds, bruises and incisions give pain.

   2. Labor; work; toil; laborious effort. In this sense, the plural only
   is used; as, to take pains; to be at the pains.

   The same with pains we gain, but lose with ease.

   3. Labor; toilsome effort; task; in the singular. [Not now used.]

   4. Uneasiness of mind; disquietude; anxiety; solicitude for the future;
   grief, sorrow for the past. We suffer pain when we fear or expect evil;
   we feel pain at the loss of friends or property.

   5. The throws or distress of travail or childbirth.

   She bowed herself and travailed, for her pains came upon her. 1 Sam.4.

   6. Penalty; punishment suffered or denounced; suffering or evil
   inflicted as a punishment for a crime, or annexed to the commission of
   a crime.

                                 PAIN, v.t.

   are pained at the death of a friend; grief pains the heart; we are
   often pained with fear or solicitude.

   I am pained at my very heart. Jer.4.

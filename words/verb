[1]verb

   VERB, n. [L. verbum, fero.]

   1. In grammar, a part of speech that expresses action, motion, being,
   suffering, or a request or command to do or forbear any thing. The verb
   affirms, declares, asks or commands; as, I write; he runs; the river
   flows; they sleep; we see; they are deceived; depart; go; come; write;
   does he improve?

   When the action expressed by a verb is exerted on an object, or
   terminates upon it, the act is considered as passing to that object,
   and the verb is called transitive; as, I read Livy. When the act
   expressed by the verb, terminates in the agent or subject, the verb is
   called intransitive; as, I run; I walk, I sleep.

   When the agent and object change places, and the agent is considered as
   the instrument by which the object is affected, the verb is called
   passive; as, Goliath was slain by David.

   2. A word.

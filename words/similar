[1]similar

   SIM'ILAR, a. [L. similis; Gr. omaloV.] Like; resembling; having a like
   form or appearance. Similar may signify exactly alike, or having a
   general likeness, a likeness in the principal points. Things perfectly
   similar, in their nature, must be of the same essence, or homogeneous;
   but we generally understand similar to denote a likeness that is not
   perfect. Many of the statutes of Connecticut are similar to the
   statutes of Massachusetts on the same subjects. The manners of the
   several states of New England are similar, the people being derived
   from common ancestors.

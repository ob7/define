[1]boy

   BOY, n. [L. puer for puger, for we see by puella, that r is not
   radical. So the Gr. probably is contracted, for the derivative verb,
   forms.]

   A male child, from birth to the age of puberty; but in general, applied
   to males under ten or twelve years of age; a lad. Sometimes it is used
   in contempt for a young man, indicating immaturity, want of vigor or
   judgment.

   BOY, v.t. To treat as a boy.

   Rather, to act as a boy; to imitate a boy in action. The passage in
   Shakespeare,in which this word is found,is supposed to allude to the
   practice of boys acting women's parts on the stage.

   I shall see some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness.

   DRAGONS-BLOOD, n. A resinous substance, or red juice, extracted from
   the Dracaena draco, and other trees of a similar nature. It comes from
   the East Indies, in small flat cakes or round balls, or in oval drops,
   wrapped in leaves, and knotted like a chaplet. It has no sensible smell
   or taste. It has been considered as an astringent medicine, but is now
   little used for medicinal purposes. A solution of it in spirit of wine
   is used for staining marble, to which it gives a red tinge.

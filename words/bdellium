[1]bdellium

   BDEL'LIUM, n. [ Bochard and Parkhurst translate it, pearl. Gen.2. But
   it is doubtful whether the bdellium of the scriptures is that now
   used.]

   A gummy resinous juice, produced by a tree in the East Indies, of which
   we have no satisfactory account. It is brought from the E. Indies and
   from Arabia, in pieces of different sizes and figures, externally of a
   dark reddish brown, internally, clear and not unlike to glue. To the
   taste, it is slightly bitterish and pungent; its odor is agreeable. In
   the mouth, it becomes soft and sticks to the teeth; on a red hot iron,
   it readily catches flame and burns with a crackling noise. It is used
   as a perfume and a medicine, being a weak deobstruent.

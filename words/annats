   AN'NATS, n. [L. annus.]

   A year's income of a spiritual living; the first fruits, originally
   given to the Pope, upon the decease of a bishop, abbot or parish clerk,
   and paid by his successor. In England, they were, at the reformation,
   vested in the king, and in the reign of Queen Anne, restored to the
   church, and appropriated to the augmentation of poor livings.

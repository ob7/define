   RAVEL, v.t. rav'l.

   1. To entangle; to entwist together; to make intricate; to involve; to
   perplex.

   What glory's due to him that could divide such ravel'd inte'rests, has
   the knot unty'd?

   2. To untwist; to unweave or unknot; to disentangle; as, to ravel out a
   twist; to ravel out a stocking.

   Sleep, that knits up the ravel'd sleeve of care.

   3. to hurry or run over in confusion. [Not in use.]

                             RAVEL, v.i. rav'l.

   1. To fall into perplexity and confusion.

   Till by their own perplexities involv'd, they ravel more, still less
   resolv'd.

   2. To work in perplexities; to busy one's self with intricacies; to
   enter by winding and turning.

   It will be needless to ravel far into the records of elder times.

   The humor of raveling into all these mystical or entangled matters -
   produced infinite diputes.

   3. To be unwoven.

   [As far as my observation extends, ravel, in the United States, is used
   only in the second sense above, viz. to unweave, to separate the
   texture of that which is woven or knit; so that ravel and unravel are
   with us always synonymous. etymology proves this to be the true sense
   of the word ravel.]

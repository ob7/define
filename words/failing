   FA'ILING, n.

   1. The act of failing; deficiency; imperfection; lapse; fault.
   Failings, in a moral sense, are minor faults, proceeding rather from
   weakness of intellect or from carelessness, than from bad motives. But
   the word is often abusively applied to vices of a grosser kind.

   2. The act of failing or becoming insolvent.

[1]arundelian

   ARUNDE'LIAN, a. Pertaining to Arundel, as Arundelian marbles. The
   Arundelian marbles are ancient stones, containing a chronological
   detail of the principal events of Greece, from Cecrops, who lived about
   1582 years before Christ, to the archonship of Diognetus, before Christ
   264. The engraving was done in Paros, and the chronology is called the
   Parian Chronicle. These stones are called arundelian from the Earl of
   Arundel, who employed William Petty to procure relics of antiquity in
   the East in 1624. These, with other curiosities, were purchased, and by
   the Earl's grandson presented to the University of Oxford. Their
   antiquity and even their authenticity has been questioned.

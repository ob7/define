[1]at

   AT, prep. [L. ad. At, ad and to, if not radically the same word often
   coincide in signification; Heb to come, to a approach. Hence it
   primarily denotes presence, meeting, nearness, direction towards.]

   In general, at denotes nearness, or presents; as at the ninth hour, at
   the house; but it is less definite than in or on; at the house, may be
   in or near the house. It denotes also towards, versus; as, to aim an
   arrow at a mark.

   From this original import are derived all the various uses of at. At
   the sight, is with, present, or coming the sight; at this news, present
   the news, on or with the approach or arrival of this news. At peace, at
   war, in a state of peace or war, peace or war, in a state of peace or
   war, peace or war existing, being present; at ease, at play, at a loss,
   &c. convey the like idea. At arms, furnished with arms, bearing arms
   present with arms; at hand, within reach of the hand, and therefore
   near; at my cost, with my cost; at his suit, by or with his suit; at
   this declaration, he rose from his seat, that is present, or coming
   this declaration; whence results the idea in consequence of it. At his
   command, is either under his command, that is, literally, coming or
   being come his command, in the power of, or in consequence of it. He is
   good at engraving, at husbandry; that is, in performing that business.
   He deserves well at our hands; that is, from us. The peculiar phrases
   in which this word occurs, with appropriate significations, are
   numerous. At first, at last, at least, at best, at the worst, at the
   highest or lowest, are phrases in which some noun is implied; as, at
   the first time or beginning; at the last time, or point of time; at the
   least or best degree, &c.; all denoting an extreme point or superlative
   degree. At all, is in any manner or degree.

   At is sometimes used for to, or towards, noting progression or
   direction; as, he aims at perfection; he makes or runs at him, or
   points at him. In this phrase, he longs to be at him, at has its
   general sense of approaching, or present, or with, in contest or
   attack.

   HEART, n. [L. cor, cordis, and allied to Eng.core, or named from
   motion, pulsation.]

   1. A muscular viscus, which is the primary organ of the blood's motion
   in an animal body, situated in the thorax. From this organ all the
   arteries arise, and in it all the veins terminate. By its alternate
   dilatation and contraction, the blood is received from the veins, and
   returned through the arteries, by which means the circulation is
   carried on and life preserved.

   2. The inner part of any thing; the middle part or interior; as the
   heart of a country, kingdom or empire; the heart of a town; the heart
   of a tree.

   3. The chief part; the vital part; the vigorous or efficacious part.

   4. The seat of the affections and passions, as of love, joy, grief,
   enmity, courage, pleasure &c.

      The heart is deceitful above all things. Every imagination of the
     thoughts of the heart is evil continually. We read of an honest and
     good heart, and an evil heart of unbelief, a willing heart, a heavy
   heart, sorrow of heart, a hard heart, a proud heart, a pure heart. The
    heart faints in adversity, or under discouragement, that is, courage
     fails; the heart is deceived, enlarged, reproved, lifted up, fixed,
                           established, moved, &c.

   5. By a metonymy, heart is used for an affection or passion, and
   particularly for love.

   The king's heart was towards Absalom. 2 Sam. 14.

   6. The seat of the understanding; as an understanding heart.
   We read of men wise in heart, and slow of heart.

   7. The seat of the will; hence, secret purposes, intentions or designs.
   There are many devices in a man's heart. The heart of kings is
   unsearchable. The Lord tries and searches the heart. David had it in
   his heart to build a house of rest for the ark.

   Sometimes heart is used for the will, or determined purpose.

   The heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. Eccles.8.

   8. Person; character; used with respect to courage or kindess.

   Cheerly, my hearts.

   9. Courage; spirit; as, to take heart; to give heart; to recover heart.

                 10. Secret thoughts; recesses of the mind.

   despised him in her heart. 2 Sam.6.

[1]coquette

   COQUET, COQUETTE, n. A vain, airy, trifling girl, who endeavors to
   attract admiration and advances in love, from a desire to gratify
   vanity, and then rejects her lover; a jilt.

   The light coquettes in sylphs aloft repair, and sport and flutter in
   the fields of air.

   Note. In French, coquet is masculine and coquette feminine; but as our
   language has no such termination for gender, it may be better to write
   coquet for both sexes, and for distinction prefix male to the word when
   applied to a man.

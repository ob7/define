[1]oak

   OAK, n. [It is probably that the first syllable, oak, was originally an
   adjective expressing some quality, as hard or strong, and by the disuse
   of tree, oak became the name of the tree.]

   A tree of the genus Quercus, or rather the popular name of the genus
   itself, of which there are several species. The white oak grows to a
   great size, and furnishes a most valuable timber; but the live oak of
   the United States is the most durable timber for ships. In Hartford
   still stands the venerable oak, in the hollow stem of which was
   concealed and preserved the colonial charter of Connecticut, when Sir
   E. Andros, by authority of a writ of quo warranto from the British
   crown, attempted to obtain possession of it, in 1687. As it was then a
   large tree, it must now be nearly three hundred years old.

[1]rend

   REND, v.t. pret. and pp. rent. [Eng. cranny, L. crena, Gr.]

   1. To separate any substance into parts with force or sudden violence;
   to tear asunder; to split; as, powder rends a rock in blasting;
   lightning rends an oak.

   An empire from its old foundation rent.

   I rend my tresses, and by breast I wound.

   Neither rend your clothes, lest ye die. Lev. 10.

   2. To separate or part with violence.

   I will surely rend the kingdom from thee. 1Kings 11.

   To rend the heart, in Scripture, to have bitter sorrow for sin. Joel 2.

   To rend the heavens, to appear in majesty. Is. 64.

   Rend differs somewhat from lacerate. We never say, to lacerate a rock
   or a kingdom, when we mean to express splitting or division. Lacerate
   is properly applicable to the tearing off of small pieces of a thing,
   as to lacerate the body with a whip or scourge; or to the tearing of
   the flesh or other thing without entire separation.

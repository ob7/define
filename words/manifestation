   MANIFESTA'TION, n. The act of disclosing what is secret, unseen or
   obscure; discovery to the eye or to the understanding; the exhibition
   of any thing by clear evidence; display; as the manifestation of God's
   power in creation, or of his benevolence in redemption.

   The secret manner in which acts of mercy ought to be performed,
   requires this public manifestation of them at the great day.

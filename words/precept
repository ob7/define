   PRE'CEPT, n. [L. proeceptum, from proecipio, to command; proe, before,
   and capio, to take.]

   1. In a general sense, any commandment or order intended as an
   authoritative rule of action; but applied particularly to commands
   respecting moral conduct. The ten commandments are so many precepts for
   the regulation of our moral conduct.

   No arts are without their precepts.

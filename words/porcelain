   POR'CELAIN, n. [L. portulaca.]

   1. The finest species of earthen ware, originally manufactured in China
   and Japan, but now made in several European countries. All earthen
   wares which are white and semi-transparent, are called porcelains, but
   they differ much in their fineness and beauty. The porcelain of China
   is said to be made of two species of earth, the petuntse, which is
   fusible, and the kaolin, which is not fusible, or not with the degree
   of heat which fuses the petuntse, and that in porcelain the substances
   are only semi-vitrified, or one substance only is vitrified, the other
   not. Hence it is concluded that porcelain is an intermediate substance
   between earth and glass. Hence the second degree of fusibility, of
   which emollescence is the first, is called by Kirwan the porcelain
   state.

   2. The plant called purslain, which see.

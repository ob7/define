[1]congeal

   CONGEAL, v.t. [L., to freeze, has the elements of cool, but it may be a
   different word.]

   1. To change from a fluid to a solid sate, as by cold, or a loss of
   heat, as water in freezing, liquid metal or wax in cooling, blood in
   stagnating or cooling, &c.; to harden into ice, or into a substance of
   less solidity. Cold congeals water into ice, or vapor into hoar frost
   or snow, and blood into a less solid mass, or clot.

   2. To bind or fix with cold. Applied to the circulating blood, it does
   not signify absolutely to harden, but to cause a sensation of cold, a
   shivering, or a receding of the blood from the extremities; as, the
   frightful scene congealed his blood.

    CONGEAL, v.i. To grow hard, stiff or thick; to pass from a fluid to a
   solid state; to concrete into a solid mass. Melted lead congelas; water
                          congeals; blood congeals.

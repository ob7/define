   AB'SENCE, n. [L. absens, from absum, abesse, to be away; ab and sum.]

   1. A state of being at a distance in place, or not in company. It is
   used to denote any distance indefinitely, either in the same town, or
   country, or in a foreign country; and primarily supposes a prior
   presence. "Speak well of one in his absence."

   2. Want; destitution; implying no previous presence. "In the absence of
   conventional law."

   3. In law, non-appearance; a not being in court to answer.

   4. Heedlessness; inattention to things present. Absence of mind is the
   attention of the mind to a subject which does not occupy the rest of
   the company, and which draws the mind from things or objects which are
   present, to others distant or foreign.

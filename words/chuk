[1]chuk

   CHUK, n. A word used in calling swine. It is the original name of that
   animal, which our ancestors brought with them from Persia, where it is
   still in use, Pers. Chuk, Zend, chuk, a hog; Sans. Sugara. Our
   ancestors, while in England, adopted the Welsh hwc, hog, but chuck is
   retained in our popular name of woodchuck, that is, wood hog. This is a
   remarkable proof of the original seat of the Teutonic nations. I have
   taken chuk from Adelung. The French cochon may be the same word.

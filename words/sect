   SECT, n. [L. Sp. secta; from L. seco, to cut off, to separate.]

   1. A body or number of persons united in tenets, chiefly in philosophy
   or religion, but constituting a distinct party by holding sentiments
   different from those of other men. Most sects have originated in a
   particular perlon, who taught and propagated some peculiar notions in
   philosophy or religion, and who is considered to have been its founder.
   Among the jews, the principal sects were the Pharisees, Sadducees, and
   Essenes. In Greece were the Cynic sect, founded by Antisthenes; and the
   Academic sect, by Plato. The Academic sect gave birth to the
   Peripatetic, and a Cynic to the Stoic.

   2. A cutting or coin. [Not used.]

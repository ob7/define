[1]almoner

   AL'MONER, n. [See Alms.]

   An officer whose duty is to distribute charity or alms. By the ancient
   canons, every monastery was to dispose of a tenth of its income in alms
   to the poor, and all bishops were obliged to keep an almoner. This
   title is sometimes given to a chaplain; as, the almoner of a ship or
   regiment.

   The Lord Almoner, or Lord High Almoner, in England, is an
   ecclesiastical officer, generally a bishop, who has the forfeiture of
   al deodands, and the goods of self-murderers, which he is to distribute
   to the poor.

   The Grand Almoner, in France, is the first ecclesiastical dignitary,
   and has the superintendence of hospitals.

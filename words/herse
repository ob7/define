   HERSE, n. hers.

   1. In fortification, a lattice or portcullis in the form of a harrow,
   set with iron spikes. It is hung by a rope fastened to a moulinet, and
   when a gate is broken, it is let down to obstruct the passage. It is
   called also a sarrasin or cataract, and when it consists of straight
   stakes without cross-pieces, it is called orgues.

    Herse is also a harrow, used for a chevaux de frise, and laid in the
    way or in breaches, with the points up, to obstruct or incommode the
                             march of an enemy.

   1. A carriage for bearing corpses to the grave. It is a frame only, or
   a box, as in England, borne on wheels.

   2. A temporary monument set over a grave. [Unusual and not legitimate.]

   3. A funeral eulogy. [Not used.]

                 HERSE, v.t. hers. To put on or in a herse.

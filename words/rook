   ROOK, n. [L. graculus; probably from its voice. See Crow and Croak.]

   1. A fowl of the genus Corvus, the fowl mentioned by Virgil under this
   name. This fowl resembles the crow, but differs from it in not feeding
   on carrion, but on insects and grain. In crows also the nostrils and
   root of the bill are clothed with feathers, but in rooks the same parts
   are naked, or have only a few bristly hairs. The rook is gregarious.

   2. A cheat; a trickish, rapacious fellow.

                       ROOK, n. A common man at chess.

                      ROOK, v.i. To cheat; to defraud.

                ROOK, v.t. To cheat; to defraud by cheating.

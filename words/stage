   1. A floor or platform of any kind elevated above the ground or common
   surface, as for an exhibition of something to pubic view; as a stage

   mechanics. Seamen use floating stages, and stages suspended by the side
   of a ship, for calking and repairing.

   2. The floor on which theatrical performances are exhibited, as
   distinct from the pit, &c. Hence,

   3. The theater; the place of scenic entertainments.

   Knights, squires and steeds must enter on the stage.

   4. Theatrical representations. It is contended that the stage is a
   school or morality. Let it be inquired, where is the person whom the
   stage has reformed?

   fifteen miles.

   9. A single step; degree of advance; degree of progression, either in
   increase or decrease, in rising or falling, or in any change of state;
   as the several stages of a war; the stages of civilization or
   improvement; stages of growth in an animal or plant; stages of a
   disease, of decline or recovery; the several stages of human life.

   running regularly from one place to another for the conveyance of
   passengers.

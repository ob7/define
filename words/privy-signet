   PRIVY-SIG'NET, n. In England, the seal which the king uses previously
   in grants, &c. which are to pass the great seal, or which he uses in
   matters of subordinate consequence, which do not require the great
   seal.

   1. Privy-seal, is used elliptically for the principal secretary of
   state, or person entrusted with the privy-seal.

   The king's sign manual is the warrant to the privy-seal, who makes out
   a writ or warrant thereon to the chancery. The sign manual is the
   warrant to the privy-seal, and the privy-seal is the warrant to the
   great seal.

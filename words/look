   LOOK, v.i. [See Light. The primary sense is to stretch, to extend, to
   shoot, hence to direct the eye. We observe its primary sense is nearly
   the same as that of seek. Hence, to look for is to seek.]

   1. To direct the eye towards an object, with the intention of seeing
   it.

   When the object is within sight, look is usually followed by on or at.
   We look on or at a picture; we look on or at the moon; we cannot look
   on or at the unclouded sun, without pain.

   At, after look, is not used in our version of the Scriptures. In common
   usage, at or on is now used indifferently in many cases, and yet in
   other cases, usage has established a preference. In general, on is used
   in the more solemn forms of expression. Moses was afraid to look on
   God. The Lord look on you and judge. In these and similar phrases, the
   use of at would be condemned, as expressing too little solemnity.

   In some cases, at seems to be more properly used before very distant
   objects; but the cases can hardly be defined.

   The particular direction of the eye is expressed by various modifying
   words; as, to look down, to look up, to look back to look forward, to
   look from, to look round, to look out, to look under. When the object
   is not in sight, look is followed by after, or for. Hence, to look
   after, or look for, is equivalent to seek or search, or to expect.

   2. To see; to have the sight or view of.

   Fate sees thy life lodged in a brittle glass, and looks it through, but
   to it cannot pass.

   3. To direct the intellectual eye; to apply the mind or understanding;
   to consider; to examine. Look at the conduct of this man; view it in
   all its aspects. Let every man look into the state of his own heart.

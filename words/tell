     Tell, though equivalent in some respects to speak and say, has not
     always the same application. We say, to tell this, that or what, to
     tell a story, to tell a word, to tell truth or falsehood, to tell a
   number, to tell the reasons, to tell something or nothing; but we never
   say, to tell a speech, discourse or oration, or to tell an argument or
   a lesson. It is much used in commands. Tell me the whole story; tell me
    all you know, or all that was said. Tell has frequently the sense of
                   narrate; which speak and say have not.

               TELL, v.i. To give an account; to make report.

   --That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all
   thy wondrous works. Ps.36.

                                 To tell of

   To tell on - to inform. You must not disobey; I will tell of you if you
     do. This is a common popular use of the word. To tell on, is quite
                         vulgar as well as improper.

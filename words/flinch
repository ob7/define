[1]flinch

   FLINCH, v.i. [I have not found this word in any other language; but the
   sense of it occurs in blench, and not improbably it is from the same
   root, with a different prefix.]

   1. To shrink; to withdraw from any suffering or undertaking, from pain
   or danger; to fail of proceeding, or of performing any thing. Never
   flinch from duty. One of the parties flinched from the combat.

   A child, by a constant course of kindness, may be accustomed to bear
   very rough usage without flinching or complaining.

   2. To fail.

   AN'GEL-FISH, n. A species of shark, the squalus squatina. It is from
   six to eight feet long, with a large head, teeth broad at the base, but
   slender and sharp above, disposed in five rows, all around the jaws.
   The fish takes its name from its pectoral fins, which are very large
   and extend horizontally, like wings when spread. This fish connects the
   genus of rays, with that of sharks, partaking of the characters of
   both; but it differs from both in this, that its mouth is placed at the
   extremity of the head.

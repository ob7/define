[1]risible

   RI'SIBLE, a. [L. risibilis, from rideo, risi, to laugh. See
   Ridiculous.]

   1. Having the faculty or power of laughing. Man is a risible animal.

   2. Laughable; capable of exciting laughter. The description of Falstaff
   in Shakespeare, exhibits a risible scene. Risible differs from
   ludicrous, as species from genus; ludicrous expressing that which is
   playful and sportive; risible, that which may excite laughter. Risible
   differs from ridiculous, as the latter implies something mean or
   contemptible, and risible does not.

[1]topping

   TOP'PING, ppr. Covering the top; capping; surpassing; cropping;
   lopping.

   1. a. Fine; gallant.

   [But Johnson's definition is probably incorrect.]

   2. Proud; assuming superiority. [This is the sense in which the common
   people of N. England use the word, and I believe the true sense, but it
   is not elegant.]

   TOP'PING, n. In seamen's language, the act of pulling one extremity of
                        a yard higher than the other.

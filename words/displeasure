   DISPLEASURE, n. Displezhur.

   1. Some irritation or uneasiness of the mind, occasioned by any thing
   that counteracts desire or command, or which opposes justice and a
   sense of propriety. A man incurs the displeasure of another by
   thwarting his views or schemes; a servant incurs the displeasure of his
   master by neglect or disobedience; we experience displeasure at any
   violation of right or decorum. Displeasure is anger, but it may be
   slight anger. It implies disaprobation or hatred, and usually expresses
   less than vexation and indignation. Thus, slighter offenses give
   displeasure, although they may not excite a violent passion.

   2. Offense; cause of irritation.

   Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a
   displeasure. Judges 15.

   3. State of disgrace or disfavor.

   He went into Poland, being in displeasure with the pope for overmuch
   familiarity.

    DISPLEASURE, v.t. To displease. [An unnecessary word, and not used.]

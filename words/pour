[1]pour

   POUR, v.t.

   1. To throw, as a fluid in a stream, either out of a vessel, or into
   it; as, to pour water from a pail, or out of a pail; to pour wine into
   a decanter. Pour is appropriately but not exclusively applied to
   fluids, and signifies merely to cast or throw, and this sense is
   modified by out, from, in, into, against, on, upon, under, &c. It is
   applied not only to liquors, but to other fluids, and to substances
   consisting of fine particles; as, to pour a stream of gas or air upon a
   fire; to pour out sand. It expresses particularly the bestowing or
   sending forth in copious abundance.

   I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh. Joel 2.

   To pour out dust. Lex.14.

   2. To emit; to send forth in a stream or continued succession.

   London doth pout out her citizens.

   3. To send forth; as, to pour out words, prayers or sighs; to pour out
   the heart or soul. Ps.62.42.

   4. To throw in profusion or with overwhelming force.

   I will shortly pour out my fury on thee. Ezek.7.

   POUR, v.i. To flow; to issue forth in a stream, or continued succession
    of parts; to move or rush, as a current. The torrent pours down from
                  the mountain, or along the steep descent.

   1. To rush in a crowd or continued procession.

   A ghastly band of giants,

   All pouring down the mountain, crowd the shore.

   EXPAN'SION, n. [L. expansio.] The act of expanding or spreading out.

   1. The state of being expanded; the enlargement of surface or bulk;
   dilatation. We apply expansion to surface, as the expansion of a sheet
   or of a lake, and to bulk, as the expansion of fluids or metals by
   heat; but not to a line or length without breadth.

   2. Extent; space to which any thing is enlarged; also, pure space or
   distance between remote bodies.

   3. Enlargement; as the expansion of the heart or affections.

     BULL, n. [L. bulla, a boss, and an ornament worn on a child's neck.
    This name was given to the seal which was appended to the edicts and
       briefs of the Pope,and in process of time, applied to the edict
                                  itself.]

   1. A letter, edict or rescript of the Pope, published or transmitted to
   the churches over which he is head, containing some decree, order or
   decision. It is used chiefly in matters of justice or of grace. If the
   former, the lead or seal is hung by a hempen cord; if the latter,by a
   silken thread. The lead or bull is impressed on one side with the heads
   of St. Peter and St. Paul; on the other with the name of the Pope and
   the year of his pontificate. The writing is in the old, round Gothic
   letter; and the instrument has about it a cross with some text of
   scripture, or religious motto.

       The Golden Bull, so called from its golden seal, is an edict or
    imperial constitution, made by the Emperor Charles V., containing the
                    fundamental law of the German Empire.

   Leaden Bulls were sent by the Emperors of Constantinople to patriarchs
   and princes; and by the grandees of the Empire of France, Sicily, &c.,
                       and by patriarchs and bishops.

     Waxen bulls were in frequent use with the Greek Emperors, who thus
                     sealed letters to their relations.

     BULL, a prefix, signifies a bull, or large, or having a large head.

[1]bilander

   BI'LANDER, n. A small merchant vessel with two masts, distinguished
   from other vessels of two masts, by the form of the main-sail, which is
   bent to the whole length of a yard, hanging fore and aft, and inclined
   to the horizon in an angle of about 45 degrees; the foremost lower
   corner, called the tack, being secured to a ring-bolt in the deck, and
   the aftermost or sheet, to the tafferel. Few vessels are now rigged in
   this manner.

   The bilander is a kind of hoy, manageable by four or five men and used
   chiefly in the canals of the Low Countries.

   FEAR, n. [See the Verb.]

   1. A painful emotion or passion excited by an expectation of evil, or
   the apprehension of impending danger. Fear expresses less apprehension
   than dread, and dread less than terror and fright. The force of this
   passion, beginning with the most moderate degree, may be thus
   expressed, fear, dread, terror, fright. Fear is accompanied with a
   desire to avoid or ward off the expected evil. Fear is an uneasiness of
   mind, upon the thought of future evil likely to befall us.

   Fear is the passion of our nature which excites us to provide for our
   security, on the approach of evil.

   2. Anxiety; solicitude.

   The principal fear was for the holy temple.

   3. The cause of fear.

   noise. Is. 24. Jer. 48.

   6. In scripture, fear is used to express a filial or a slavish passion.
   In good men, the fear of God is a holy awe or reverence of God and his
   laws, which springs from a just view and real love of the divine
   character, leading the subjects of it to hate and shun every thing that
   can offend such a holy being, and inclining them to aim at perfect
   obedience. This is filial fear.

   I will put my fear in their hearts. Jer. 32.

   Slavish fear is the effect or consequence of guilt; it is the painful
   apprehension of merited punishment. Rom. 8.

   The love of God casteth out fear. 1John 4.

                           FEAR, v.t. [L. vereor.]

   1. To feel a painful apprehension of some impending evil; to be afraid
   of; to consider or expect with emotions of alarm or solicitude. We fear

   punishment of our sins.

   2. To reverence; to have a reverential awe; to venerate.

   This do, and live: for I fear God. Gen. 42.

   3. To affright; to terrify; to drive away or prevent approach by fear,
   or by a scarecrow. [This seems to be the primary meaning, but now
   obsolete.]

   We must not make a scarecrow of the law, setting it up to fear the
   birds of prey.

[1]abacus

   AB'ACUS, n. [L. anything flat, as a cupboard, a bench, a slate, a table
   or board for games; Gr. Usually deduced from the Oriental, abak, dust,
   because the ancients used tables covered with dust for making figures
   and diagrams.]

   1. Among the Romans, a cupboard or buffet.

   2. An instrument to facilitate operations in arithmetic; on this are
   drawn lines; a counter on the lowest line, is one; on the next, ten; on
   the third, a hundred, &e. On the spaces, counters denote half the
   number of the line above. Other schemes are called by the same name.
   The name is also given to a table of numbers, cast up as an abacus of
   addition; and by analogy, to the art of numbering, as in Knighton's
   Chronicon.

   3. In architecture, a table constituting the upper member or crowning
   of a column and its capital. It is usually square, but sometimes its
   sides are arched inwards. The name is also given to a concave molding
   on the capital of the Tuscan pedestal; and to the plinth above the
   boultin in the Tuscan and Doric orders.

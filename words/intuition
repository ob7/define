   INTUI'TION, n. [L. intuitus, intueor; in and tueor.]

   A looking on; a sight or view; but restricted to mental view or
   perception. Particularly and appropriately,the act by which the mind
   perceives the agreement or disagreement of two ideas, or the truth of
   things, immediately, or the moment they are presented, without the
   intervention of other ideas, or without reasoning and deduction.

   We know by intuition, that a part is less than the whole.

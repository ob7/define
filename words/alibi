   AL'IBI, n. [L.] Elsewhere; in another place; a law term. When a person
   is charged with an offense, and he proves that he could not have
   committed it, because he was, at the time, in another place, he is said
   to prove an alibi. The part of a plea or allegation, which avers the
   party to have been in another place, is also called an alibi.

[1]embryon

   EM'BRYON, n. [L. embryon; Gr. to shoot, bud, germinate. The Greek word
   is contracted, and if so, it coincides in elements with Eng. brood and
   breed.]

   In physiology, the first rudiments of an animal in the womb, before the
   several members are distinctly formed; after which it is called a
   fetus.

   1. The rudiments of a plant.

   2. The beginning or first state of any thing not fit for production;
   the rudiments of any thing yet imperfectly formed.

   The company little suspected what a noble work I had then in embryo.

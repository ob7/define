   GEN'ERAL, a. [L. generalis, from genus, a kind.]

   1. Properly, relating to a whole genus or kind; and hence, relating to
   a whole class or order. Thus we speak of a general law of the animal or
   vegetable economy. This word, though from genus, kind, is used to
   express whatever is common to an order, class, kind, sort or species,
   or to any company or association of individuals.

   2. Comprehending many species or individuals; not special or
   particular; as, it is not logical to draw a general inference or
   conclusion from a particular fact.

   3. Lax in signification; not restrained or limited to a particular
   import; not specific; as a loose and general expression.

   4. Public; common; relating to or comprehending the whole community; as
   the general interest or safety of a nation.

   5. Common to many or the greatest number; as a general opinion; a
   general custom.

   6. Not directed to a single object.

   If the same thing be peculiarly evil, that general aversion will be
   turned into a particular hatred against it.

   7. Having a relation to all; common to the whole. Adam, our general
   sire.

   8. Extensive, though not universal; common; usual.

     This word is prefixed or annexed to words, to express the extent of
    their application. Thus a general assembly is an assembly of a whole
   body, in fact or by representation. In Scotland, it is the whole church
   convened by its representatives. In America, a legislature is sometimes
                         called a general assembly.

   In logic, a general term is a term which is the sign of a general idea.

       An attorney general, and a solicitor general, is an officer who
   conducts suits and prosecutions for the king or for a nation or state,
           and whose authority is general in the state or kingdom.

      A vicar general has authority as vicar or substitute over a whole
                         territory or jurisdiction.

   An adjutant general assists the general of an army, distributes orders,
                            receives returns, &c.

     The word general thus annexed to a name of office, denotes chief or
         superior; as a commissary general, quarter-master general.

   In the line, a general officer is one who commands an army, a division
                                or a brigade.

    GEN'ERAL, n. The whole; the total; that which comprehends all or the
                     chief part; opposed to particular.

   In particulars our knowledge begins, and so spreads itself by degrees
   to generals.

   A history painter paints man in general.

   1. In general, in the main; for the most part; not always or
   universally.

   I have shown that he excels, in general,under each of these heads.

   2. The chief commander of an army. But to distinguish this officer from
   other generals, he is often called general in chief. The officer second
   in rank is called lieutenant general.

   3. The commander of a division of an army or militia, usually called a
   major general.

   4. The commander of a brigade, called a brigadier general.

   5. A particular beat of drum or march, being that which, in the
   morning, gives notice for the infantry to be in readiness to march.

   6. The chief of an order of monks, or of all the houses or
   congregations established under the same rule.

   STALE, a. [I do not find this word in the other Teutonic dialects. It
   is probably from the root of still, G., to set, and equivalent to
   stagnant.]

   from being long kept; as stale beer.

   2. Having lost the life or graces of youth; worn out; decayed; as a
   stale virgin.

   3. Worn out by use; trite; common; having lost its novelty and power of
   pleasing; as a stale remark.

   4. A long handle; as the state of a rake.

   5. A word applied to the king in chess when stalled or set; that is,
   when so situated that he cannot be moved without going into check, by
   which the game is ended.

   STALE, v.t. To make void or useless; to destroy the life, beauty or use
                              of; to wear out.

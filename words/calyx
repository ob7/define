[1]calyx

   CALYX, n. plu. calyxes. The outer covering of a flower, being the
   termination of the cortical epidermis or outer bark of the plant,
   which, in most plants, incloses and supports the bottom of the corol.
   In Linnes system, it comprehends the perianth, the involucrum, the
   ament, the spath, the glume, the calyptra, and the volva. But in
   general it signifies the perianth, and the leaves are generally green.

   The opinion of Linne that the calyx is the continuation of the
   epidermis is now considered erroneous.

   ASPERIFO'LIATE, a. [L. asper, rough, and folium, a leaf.]

   Having rough leaves. Plants of this kind are, by some authors,
   classified according to this character. They constitute the forty-first
   order of Linne's fragments of a natural method. In the methods of
   Herman, Boerhave, and Ray, this class consists of plants which have
   four naked seeds. Their leaves stand alternately on the stalks, and the
   flower is monopetalous in five divisions.

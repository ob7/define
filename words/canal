[1]canal

   CANAL, n.

   1. A passage for water; a water course; properly, a long trench or
   excavation in the earth for conducting water, and confining it to
   narrow limits; but the term may be applied to other water courses. It
   is chiefly applied to artificial cuts or passages for water, used for
   transportation; whereas channel is applicable to a natural water
   course.

   The canal from the Hudson to Lake Erie is one of the noblest works of
   art.

   2. In anatomy, a duct or passage in the body of an animal, through
   which any of the juices flow, or other substances pass; as the neck of
   the bladder, and the alimentary canal.

   3. A surgical instrument; a splint.

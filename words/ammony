   AM'MONY, n. [The real origin of this word is not ascertained. Some
   authors suppose it to be from Ammon, a title of Jupiter, near whose
   temple in upper Egypt, it was generated. Others suppose it to be from
   Ammonia, a Cyrenaic territory; and others deduce it from sand, as it
   was found in sandy ground. anglicized, this forms an elegant word,
   ammony.]

   Volatile alkali; a substance, which, in its purest form, exists in a
   state of gas. It is composed of hydrogen and nitrogen. Combined with
   the muriatic acid, it forms the muriate of ammonia, called also sal
   ammoniac and hydro-chlorate of ammonia. Native muriate of ammony is
   found in Egypt, where it is said to be generated in large inns and
   caravanseras, from the excrements of camels and other beasts. It occurs
   also massive and crystallized in the vicinity of volcanoes. Ammony,
   popularly called hartshorn, is extremely pungent and acrid, but when
   diluted, is an agreeable stimulant. it extinguishes flame, and is fatal
   to animal life. It combines with acids, and produces a class of salts,
   which, with few exceptions, are soluble in water.

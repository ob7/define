   ANTANACLA'SIS, n. [Gr. a driving back.]

   1. In rhetoric, a figure, which consists in repeating the same word in
   a different sense; as, whilst we live, let us live. Learn some craft
   when young, that when old you may live without craft.

   2. It is also a repetition of words, beginning a sentence, after a long
   parenthesis; as, shall that heart, (which not only feels them, but
   which has all motions of life placed in them,) shall that heart, &c.

[1]perdition

   PERDI'TION, n. [L. perditio, from perdo, to lose, to ruin.]

   1. Entire loss or ruin; utter destruction; as the perdition of the
   Turkish fleet.

   [In this sense, the word is now nearly or wholly obsolete.]

   2. The utter loss of the soul or of final happiness in a future state;
   future misery or eternal death. The impenitent sinner is condemned to
   final perdition.

   If we reject the truth, we seal our own perdition.

   3. Loss. [Not used.]

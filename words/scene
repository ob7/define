[1]scene

   SCENE, n. [L. scena; Gr. Heb. The Greek word signifies a tent, hut or
   cottage. In L. it is an arbor or stage. The primary sense is to set or
   throw down.]

   1. A stage; the theater or place where dramatic pieces and other shows
   are exhibited. It does not appear that the ancients changed the scenes
   in different parts of the play. Indeed the original scene for acting
   was an open plat of ground, shaded or slightly covered.

   2. The whole series of actions and events connected and exhibited; or
   the whole assemblage of objects displayed at one view. Thus we say, the
   execution of a malefactor is a melancholy scene. The crucifixion of our
   Saviour was the most solemn scene ever presented to the view of man.

   We say also, a scene of sorrow or of rejoicing, a noble scene, a sylvan
   scene.

   A charming scene of nature is display'd.

   3. A part of a play; a division of an act. A play is divided into acts,
   and acts are divided into scenes.

   4. So much of an act of a play as represents what passes between the
   same persons in the same place.

   5. The place represented by the sate. The scene was laid in the king's
   palace.

   6. The curtain or hanging of a theater adapted to the play.

   7. The place where any thing is exhibited.

   The world is a vast scene of strife.

   8. Any remarkable exhibition.

   The shepherds, while watching their flocks upon the plains of Bethehem,
   were suddenly interrupted by one of the most sublime and surprising
   scenes which have ever been exhibited on earth.

[1]tragedy

   TRAG'EDY, n. [Gr. said to be composed of a goat, and a song, because
   originally it consisted in a hymn sung in honor of Bacchus by a chorus
   of music, with dances and the sacrifice of a goat.]

   1. A dramatic poem representing some signal action performed by
   illustrious persons, and generally having a fatal issue. Aeschylus is
   called the father of tragedy.

   All our tragedies are of kings and princes.

   2. A fatal and mournful event; any event in which human lives are lost
   by human violence, more particularly by unauthorized violence.

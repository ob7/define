                                  RENT, n.

   A sum of money, or a certain amount of other valuable thing, issuing
   yearly from lands or tenements; a compensation or return, in the nature
   of an acknowledgment, for the possession of a corporeal inheritance.

   Rents, at common law, are of three kinds; rent-service, rent-charge,
   and rent-seek. Rent-service is when some corporal service is incident
   to it, as by fealty and a sum of money; rent-charge is when the owner
   of the rent has no future interest or reversion expectant in the land,
   but the rent is reserved in the deed by a clause of distress for rent
   in arrear; rent-seek, dry rent, is rent reserved by deed, but without
   any clause of distress. There are also rents of assize, certain
   established rents of free-holders and copy-holders of manors, which
   cannot be varied; called also quit-rents. These when payable in silver,
   are called white rents, in contradistinction to rents reserved in work
   or the baser metals, called black rents, or black mail. Rack-rent is a
   rent of the full value of the tenement, or near it. A fee farm rent is
   a rent-charge issuing out of an estate in fee, of at least one fourth
   of the value of the lands at the time of its reservation.

                                 RENT, v.t.

   1. To lease; to grant the possession and enjoyment of lands or
   tenements for a consideration in the nature of rent. The owner of an
   estate or house rents it to a tenant for a term of years.

   2. To take and hold by lease the possession of land or a tenement, for
   a consideration in the nature of rent. The tenant rents his estate for
   a year.

    RENT, v.i. To be leased, or let for rent; as, an estate or a tenement
                   rents for five hundred dollars a year.

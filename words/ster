[1]ster

   STER, in composition, is from the Sax. Steora, a director. See Steer.
   It seems primarily to have signified chief, principal or director, as
   in the L. Minister, chief servant; but in other words, as in spinster,
   we do not recognize the sense of chief, but merely that of a person who
   carries on the business of spinning.

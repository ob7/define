   TAM'ARIND, n. A tree, a native of the East Indies, and of Arabia and
   Egypt. It is cultivated in both the Indies for the sake of its shade
   and for its cooling, grateful acid fruit, the pulp of which, mixed with
   boiled sugar, is imported into northern countries. The stem of the tree
   is lofty, large, and crowned with wide spreading branches; the flowers
   are in simple clusters, terminating the short lateral branches.

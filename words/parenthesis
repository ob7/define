   PAREN'THESIS, n. [Gr. to insert.] A sentence, or certain words inserted
   in a sentence, which interrupt the sense or natural connection of
   words, but serve to explain or qualify the sense of the principal
   sentence. The parenthesis is usually included in hooks or curved lines,
   thus.

   These officers, whom they still call bishops, are to be elected to a
   provision comparatively mean, through the same arts, (that is,
   electioneering arts,) by men of all religious tenets that are known or
   can be invented.

   Do not suffer every occasional thought to carry you away into a long
   parenthesis.

[1]courage

   COURAGE, n. [L., the heart.] Bravery; intrepidity; that quality of mind
   which enables men to encounter danger and difficulties with firmness,
   or without fear or depression of spirits; valor; boldness; resolution.
   It is a constituent part of fortitude; but fortitude implies patience
   to bear continued suffering.

   Courage that grows from constitution, often forsakes a man when he has
   occasion for it; courage which arises from a sense of duty, acts in a
   uniform manner.

   Be strong and of good courage. Deuteronomy 31.

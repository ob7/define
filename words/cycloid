[1]cycloid

   CYCLOID, n. A geometrical curve on which depends the doctrine of
   pendulums; a figure made by the upper end of the diameter of a circle,
   turning about a right line. The genesis of a cycloid may be conceived
   by imagining a nail in the circumference of a wheel; the line which the
   nail describes in the air, while the wheel revolves in a right line, is
   the cycloid.

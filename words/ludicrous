[1]ludicrous

   LU'DICROUS, a. [L. ludicer, from ludo, to sport.]

   Sportive; burlesque; adapted to raise laughter, without scorn or
   contempt. Ludicrous differs from ridiculous; the latter implying
   contempt or derision.

   Plutarch quotes this instance of Homer's judgment, in closing a
   ludicrous scene with decency and instruction.

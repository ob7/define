   LUFF, n. The palm of the hand.

   LUFF, n.

   Weather-gage, or part towards the wind; or the sailing of a ship close
   to the wind.

   LUFF, v.i. To turn the head of a ship towards the wind; to sail nearer
   the wind. Hence, in the imperative, luff, is an order to put the tiller
    on the lee-side, in order to make the ship sail nearer the wind. Luff
     round, or luff a-lee, is the extreme of this movement, intended to
   throw the ship's head into the wind. A ship is said to spring her luff,
           when she yields to the helm by sailing nearer the wind.

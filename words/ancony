   AN'CONY, n. [Probably from Gr., the cubit, from its resemblance to the
   arm.]

   In iron works, a piece of half wrought iron, in the shape of a bar in
   the middle, but rude and unwrought at the ends. A piece of cast iron is
   melted off and hammered at a forge, into a mass of two feet long and
   square, which is called a bloom; then, carried to a finery, and worked
   into an ancony; it is then sent to a chafery, where the ends are
   wrought into the shape of the middle, and whole is made into a bar.

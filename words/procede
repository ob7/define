[1]procede

   PROCE'DE, v.i. [L. procedo; pro, forward, and cedo, to move. the more
   correct orthography is procede, in analogy with precede, concede,
   recede, procedure.]

   1. To move, pass or go forward from one place to another; applied to
   persons or things. A man proceeds on his journey; a ship proceeds on
   her voyage.

   This word thus used implies that the motion, journey or voyage had been
   previously commenced, and to proceed is then to renew or continue the
   motion or progress.

   2. To pass from one point, stage or topic to another. The preacher
   proceeds from one division of his subject, and the advocate from one
   argument, to another.

   3. To issue or come as from a course or fountain. Light proceeds from
   the sun; vice proceeds from a depraved heart; virtuous affections
   proceed from God.

   4. To come from a person or place. Christ says, "I proceeded forth and
   came from God." John 8.

   5. To prosecute any design.

   He that proceeds on other principles in his inquiry into any sciences,
   posts himself in a party.

   6. To be transacted or carried on.

   He will, after his sour fashion, tell you,

   What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.

   [Not now in use.]

   7. To make progress; to advance.

   8. To begin and carry on a series of actions or measures. The attorney
   was at a loss in what manner to proceed against the offender. In this
   sense, the word is often followed by against.

   9. To transact; to act; to carry on methodically.

   From them I will not hide

   My judgments, how with mankind I proceed.

                            10. To have a course.

   This rule only proceeds and takes place, when a person cannot of common
   law condemn another by his sentence.

                 11. To issue; to be produced or propagated.

   From my loins thou shalt proceed.

    12. To be produced by an effectual cause. All created things proceed
                                  from God.

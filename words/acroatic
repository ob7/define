   ACROAT'IC, a. [Gr.]

   Abstruse; pertaining to deep learning; and opposed to exoteric.
   Aristotle's lectures were of two kinds, acroatic, acroamatic, or
   esoteric, which were delivered to a class of select disciples, who had
   been previously instructed in the elements of learning; and exoteric,
   which were delivered in public. The former respected being, God, and
   nature; the principal subjects of the latter were logic, rhetoric, and
   policy. The abstruse lectures were called acroatics.

   PRO'BATE, n. [L. probatus, probo, to prove.]

   1. The probate of a will or testament is the proving of its genuineness
   and validity, or the exhibition of the will to the proper officer, with
   the witnesses if necessary, and the process of determining its
   validity, and the registry of it, and such other proceedings as the
   laws prescribe, as preliminary to the execution of it by the executor.

   2. The right or jurisdiction of proving wills. In England, the
   spiritual court has the probate of wills. In the United States, the
   probate of wills belongs to a court of civil jurisdiction established
   by law, usually to a single judge, called a judge of probate, or a
   surrogate.

   3. Proof. [Not used.]

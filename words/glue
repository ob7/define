[1]glue

   GLUE, n. glu. [L. gluten.]

   Inspissated animal gluten; a tenacious, viscid matter, which serves as
   a cement to unite other substances. It is made of the skins, parings,
   &c. of animals, as of oxen, calves or sheep, by boiling them to a
   jelly.

   GLUE, v.t. To join with glue or a viscous substance. Cabinet makers
   glue together some parts of furniture.

   1. To unite; to hold together.

     [This word is now seldom used in a figurative sense. The phrases,to
     glue friends together, vices glue us to low pursuits or pleasures,
    found in writers of the last century, are not now used, or are deemed
                                 inelegant.]

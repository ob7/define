   DISTRACTION, n. [L.]

   1. The act of distracting; a drawing apart; separation.

   2. Confusion from a multiplicity of objects crowding on the mind and
   calling the attention different ways; perturbation of mind; perplexity;
   as, the family was in a state of distraction. [See 1 Corinthians 7.]

   3. Confusion of affairs; tumult; disorder; as political distractions.

   Never was known a night of such distraction.

   4. Madness; a state of disordered reason; franticness; furiousness. [We
   usually apply this word to a state of derangement which produces raving
   and violence in the patient.]

   5. Folly in the extreme, or amounting to insanity.

   On the supposition of the truth of the birth, death and resurrection of
   Jesus Christ, irreligion is nothing better than distraction.

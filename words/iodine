[1]iodine

   I'ODINE, n. [Gr. resembling a violet.] In chimistry, a peculiar
   substance recently discovered by Courtois, a manufacturer of salt-peter
   in Paris. It is obtained from certain sea-weeds or marine plants. At
   the ordinary temperature of the atmosphere it is a solid, apparently a
   simple substance, at least hitherto undecomposed. It is incombustible,
   but in combining with several bodies, it exhibits the phenomena of
   combustion; hence it has been considered a supporter of combustion.
   Like chlorine, it destroys vegetable colors,but with less energy. Its
   color is bluish black or grayish black, of a metallic luster. It is
   often in scales, resembling those of micaceous iron ore; sometimes in
   brilliant rhomboidal plates, or in elongated octahedrons. Its taste is
   acrid, and it is somewhat poisonous. It is fusible at 225 deg. of
   Fahrenheit. The color of its vapor is a beautiful violet,whence its
   name.

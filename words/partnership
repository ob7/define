   P`ARTNERSHIP, n. The association of two or more persons for the purpose
   of undertaking and prosecuting any business, particularly trade or
   manufactures, at their joint expense. In this case, the connection is
   formed by contract; each partner furnishing a part of the capital stock
   and being entitled to a proportional share of profit, or subject to a
   proportional share of loss; or one or more of the partners may furnish
   money or stock, and the other or others contribute their services. The
   duration of the partnership may be limited by the contract, or it may
   be left indefinite,subject to be dissolved by mutual agreement. A
   partnership or association of this kind is a standing or permanent
   company, and is denominated a firm or house. We say, A and B entered
   into partnership for the importation and sale of goods, or for
   manufacturing cotton or glass.

   Partnerships may be and usually are associations of private persons,
   not incorporated. In other cases, the company is incorporated. Banking
   companies in the United States are usually incorporated, and are
   essentially partnerships,but do not bear that name. Manufacturing
   companies are also frequently incorporated.

   1. Joint interest or property.

   AN'THER, n. [L. anthera, a flowery plant, from the Greek, flowery, from
   a flower.]

   In botany, the summit or top of the stamen, connected with the flower,
   and elevated by means of the filament or thread, within the corol. It
   contains the pollen, or fertilizing dust, which, when mature, is
   emitted for the impregnation of the stigma. It is called by Ray, the
   apex, and by Malpighi, the capsula staminis.

   stereotype, or in stereotype. In the latter use, the word seems rather
   to signify the workmanship or manner of printing, than the plate.

   2. The art of making plates of fixed metallic types, or of executing
   work on such plates.

   stereotype work; stereotype printing; a stereotype copy of the Bible.

   STEREOTYPE, v.t. To make fixed metallic types or plates of type metal,

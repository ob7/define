   SQUIRREL, n. [L., Gr., shade, and tail.] A small quadruped of the genus
   Sciurus, order of Glires, and class Mammalia. The squirrel has two
   cutting teeth in each jaw, four toes on the fore feet, and five on the
   hind feet. Several species are enumerated. Among these are the gray,
   the red, and the black squirrel. These animals are remarkably nimble,
   running up tress and leaping from branch to branch with surprising
   agility. They subsist on nuts, of which they lay up a store for winter,
   some of them in hollow trees, others in the earth. Their flesh is
   delicate food.

[1]actuate

   ACT'UATE, a. Put in action. [Little used.]

   ACT'UATE, v.t. [from act.]

   To put into action; to move or incite to action; as, men are actuated
   by motives, or passions. It seems to have been used formerly in the
   sense of invigorate, noting increase of action; but the use is not
   legitimate.

   FRIG'ATE, n. [Gr. signifies not fortified. L. aphractum, an open ship
   or vessel.]

   1. A ship of war, of a size larger than a sloop or brig, and less than
   a ship of the line; usually having two decks and carrying from thirty
   to forty four guns. But ships mounting a less number than thirty guns
   are sometimes called frigates; as are ships carrying a larger number.

   2. Any small vessel on the water. [Not used.]

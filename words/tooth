   TOOTH, n. plu. teeth. [L. dens.]

   1. A bony substance growing out of the jaws of animals, and serving as
   the instrument of mastication. The teeth are also very useful in
   assisting persons in the utterance of words, and when well formed and
   sound, they are ornamental. The teeth of animals differ in shape, being
   destined for different offices. The front teeth in men and quadrupeds
   are called incisors, or incisive or cutting teeth; next to these are
   the pointed teeth, called canine or dog teeth; and on the sides of the
   jaws are the molar teeth or grinders.

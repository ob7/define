   'ARCHITRAVE, n. [Gr. chief, and L. trabs, a beam.]

   In architecture, the lower division of an entablature, or that part
   which rests immediately on the column. It probably represents the beam
   which, in ancient buildings, extended from column to column, to support
   the roof.

   In chimneys, the architrave is called the mantle piece; and over doors
   and windows, the hyperthyrion.

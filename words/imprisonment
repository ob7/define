   IMPRIS'ONMENT, n. The act of putting and confining in prison;

   the act of arresting and detaining in custody.

   1. Confinement in a place; restraint of liberty to go from place to
   place at pleasure. Appropriately, the confinement of a criminal or
   debtor within the walls of a prison, or in the custody of a sheriff,
   &c.

    False imprisonment is any confinement of the person, or restraint of
   liberty, without legal or sufficient authority. The arrest or detention
   of the person by an officer without warrant, or by an illegal warrant,
        or by a legal warrant executed at an unlawful time, is false
                                imprisonment.

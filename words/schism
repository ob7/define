[1]schism

   SCHISM, n. sizm. [L. schisma; Gr. to divide, L. scindo.]

   1. In a general sense, division or separation; but appropriately, a
   division or separation in a church or denomination of christians,
   occasioned by diversity of opinions; breach of unity among people of
   the same religious faith.

   - Set bounds to our passions by reason, to our errors by truth, and to
   our schisms by charity.

   In Scripture, the word seems to denote a breach of charity, rather than
   a difference of doctrine.

   2. Separation; division among tribes or classes of people.

   PLAN'ET, n. [L. planeta; Gr. wandering, to wander, allied to L. planus.
   See Plant.] A celestial body which revolves about the sun or other
   center, or a body revolving about another planet as its center. The
   planets which revolve about the sun as their center, are called primary
   planets; those which revolve about other planets as their center, and
   with them revolve about the sun, are called secondary planets,
   satellites or moons. The primary planets are named Mercury, Venus,
   Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Herschell. Four smaller planets,
   denominated by some, asteroids, namely, Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta,
   have recently been discovered between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
   Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Herschell, being without the earth's orbit,
   are sometimes called the superior planets; Venus and Mercury, being
   within the earth's orbit, are called inferior planets. The planets are
   opake bodies which receive their light from the sun. They are so named
   from their motion or revolution, in distinction from the fixed
   stars,and are distinguished from the latter by their not twinkling.

[1]tendency

   TEND'ENCY, n. [from tend; L. tendens, tending.] Drift; direction or
   course towards any place, object, effect or result. Read such books
   only as have a good moral tendency. Mild language has a tendency to
   allay irritation.

   Writings of this kind, if conducted with candor, have a more particular
   tendency to the good of their country.

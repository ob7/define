   CHISTIANITY, n. [See Christian, from Christ.] The religion of
   Christians; or the system of doctrines and precepts taught by Christ,
   and recorded by the evangelists and apostles.

   Whilst politicians are disputing about monarchies, aristocracies, and
   republics, Christianity is alike applicable, useful and friendly to
   them all.

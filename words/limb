[1]limb

   LIMB, n. lim. [L. limbus, edge or border, extremity; limes, limit. The
   sense of limb is from shooting or extending.]

   1. Edge or border. This is the proper signification of the word; but in
   this sense it is limited chiefly to technical use, and applied to the
   sun, moon, or a star, to a leaf, to a quadrant, &c. We say, the sun or
   moon is eclipsed on its northern limb. But we never say, the limb of a
   board, of a tract of land or water, &c.

   2. In anatomy, and in common use, an extremity of the human body; a
   member; a projecting part; as the arm or leg; that is, a shoot.

   3. The branch of a tree; applied only to a branch of some size, and not
   to a small twig.

   4. In botany, the border or upper spreading part of a monopetalous
   corol.

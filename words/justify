   JUST'IFY, v.t. [L. justus, just,and facio, to make.]

   1. To prove or show to be just, or conformable to law, right, justice,
   propriety or duty; to defend or maintain; to vindicate as right. We
   cannot justify disobedience or ingratitude to our Maker. We cannot
   justify insult or incivility to our fellow men. Intemperance, lewdness,
   profaneness and dueling are in no case to be justified.

   2. In theology, to pardon and clear form guilt; to absolve or acquit
   from guilt and merited punishment, and to accept as righteous on
   account of the merits of the Savior, or by the application of Christ's
   atonement to the offender.

   3. To cause another to appear comparatively righteous, or less guilty
   than one's self. Ezek. 16.

   4. To judge rightly of.

   Wisdom is justified by her children. Matt.11.

   5. To accept as just and treat with favor. James 2.

    JUST'IFY, v.i. In printing, to agree; to suit; to conform exactly; to
       form an even surface or true line with something else. Types of
              different sizes will not justify with each other.

   something of supposed equal value; to barter; and in vulgar language,

   compensation the same thing.

   4. To give and receive the like thing; as to exchange thoughts; to
   exchange work; to exchange blows; to exchange prisoners.

   It has with before the person receiving the thing given, and for before
     the equivalent. Will you exchange horses with me? Will you exchange
                            your horse for mine?

   EXCHANGE, n. In commerce, the act of giving one thing or commodity for
   another; barter; traffic by permutation, in which the thing received is
                supposed to be equivalent to the thing given.

   1. The act of giving up or resigning one thing or state for another,
   without contract.

   2. The act of giving and receiving reciprocally; as an exchange of
   thoughts; an exchange of civilities.

   3. The contract by which one commodity is transferred to another for an
   equivalent commodity.

   4. The thing given in return for something received; or the thing
   received in return for what is given.

   In ordinary business, this is called change.

   5. The form of exchanging one debt or credit for another; or the
   receiving or paying of money in one place, for an equal sum in another,
   by order, draft or bill of exchange. A in London is creditor to B in
   New York, and C in London owed D in New York a like sum. A in London
   draws a bill of exchange on B in New York; C in London purchases the
   bill, by which A receives his debt due from B in New York. C transmits
   the bill to D in New York, who receives the amount from B.

   Bills of exchange, drawn on persons in a foreign country, are called
   foreign bills of exchange; the like bills, drawn on persons in
   different parts or cities of the same country, are called inland bills
   of exchange.

   A bill of exchange is a mercantile contract in which four persons are
   primarily concerned.

   6. In mercantile language, a bill drawn for money is called exchange,
   instead of a bill of exchange.

   7. The course of exchange, is the current price between two places,
   which is above or below par, or at par. Exchange is at par, when a bill
   in New York for the payment of one hundred pounds sterling in London,
   can be purchased for one hundred pounds. If it can be purchased for
   less, exchange is under par. If the purchases is obliged to give more,
   exchange is above par.

   8. In law, a mutual grant of equal interest, the one in consideration
   of the other. Estates exchanged must be equal in quantity, as fee
   simple for fee simple.

[1]hemisphere

   HEM'ISPHERE, n. [Gr.] A half sphere; one half of a sphere or globe,
   when divided by a plane passing through its center. In astronomy, one
   half the mundane sphere. The equator divides the sphere into two equal
   parts. That on the north is called the northern hemisphere; the other,
   the southern. So the horizon divides the sphere into the upper and
   lower hemispheres. Hemisphere is also used for a map or projection of
   half the terrestrial or celestial sphere, and is then often called
   planisphere.

   1. A map or projection of half the terrestrial globe.

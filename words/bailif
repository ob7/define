   sheriff. Bailiffs are either special, and appointed, for their
   adroitness, to arrest persons; or bailiffs of hundreds, who collect
   fines, summon juries, attend the assizes, and execute writs and
   process. The sheriff in England is the king's bailiff.

   There are also bailiffs of liberties, appointed by the lords in their
   respective jurisdictions, to execute process, and perform other duties;
   bailiffs of forests and manors, who direct the husbandry, collect
   rents,&c; and water bailiffs in each port, to search vessels, gather
   toll for anchorage, arrest persons for debt on the water,&c.

   The office of bailiff formerly was high and honorable in England, and
   officers under that title on the continent are still invested with
   important functions.

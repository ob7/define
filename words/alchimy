   AL'CHIMY, n. [See Chimistry.]

   1. The more sublime and difficult part of chimistry, and chiefly such
   as relate to the transmutation of metals are gold, the finding a
   universal remedy for diseases, and an alkabest or universal solvent,
   and other things now treated as ridiculous. This pretended science was
   much cultivated in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but is now
   held in contempt.

   2. formerly, a mixed metal used for utensils.

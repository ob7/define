   EXPLO'RE, v.t. [L. exploro; ex and ploro, to cry out, to wail, to bawl.
   The compound appears to convey a very different sense from the simple
   verb ploro; but the primary sense is to stretch, strain, drive; applied
   to the voice, it is to strain or press out sounds or words; applied to
   the eyes, it is to stretch or reach, as in prying curiosity.]

   1. To search for making discovery; to view with care; to examine
   closely by the eye.

   Moses sent spies to explore the land of Canaan.

   2. To search by any means; to try; as, to explore the deep by a plummet
   or lead.

   3. To search or pry into; to scrutinize; to inquire with care; to
   examine closely with a view to discover truth; as, to explore the
   depths of science.

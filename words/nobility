   NOBIL'ITY, n.

   1. Dignity of mind; greatness; grandeur; that elevation of soul which
   comprehends bravery, generosity, magnamimity, intrepidity, and contempt
   of every thing that dishonors character.

   over it.

   They thought it great their sovereign to control, and named their
   pride, nobility of soul.

   2. Antiquity of family; descent from noble ancestors; distinction by
   blood, usually joined with riches.

   When I took up Boccace unawares, I fell on the same argument of
   preferring virtue to nobility of blood and titles, in the story of
   Sigismunda.

   3. The qualities which constitute distinction of rank in civil society,
   according to the customs or laws of the country; that eminence or
   dignity which a man derives from birth or title conferred, and which

   extended to five ranks, those of duke, marquis, earl, viscount and
   baron.

   4. The persons collectively who enjoy rank above commoners; the
   peerage; as the English nobility; French, German, Russian nobility.

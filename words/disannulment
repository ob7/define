[1]disannulment

   DISANNULMENT, n. The act of making void; as the disannulment of a law
   or decree.

   Disannual differs from repeal, as the genus from the species. A repeal
   makes a law void by the same power that enacted it. Annulment or
   disannulment destroys its force and authority by repeal or by other
   means.

   DUNNING, ppr. [from dun.] Urging for payment of a debt, or for the
   grant of some favor, or for the obtaining any request; importuning.

   DUNNING, ppr. Or n. [from dun, a color.] The operation of curing
   codfish, in such a manner as to give it a particular color and quality.
   Fish for dunning are caught early in spring, and often in February. At
   the Isles of Shoals, off Portsmouth, in New Hampshire, the cod are
   taken in deep water, split and slack-salted; then laid in a pile for
   two or three months, in a dark store, covered, for the greatest part of
   the time, with salt-hay or eel-grass, and pressed with some weight. In
   April or May, they are opened and piled again as close as possible in
   the same dark store, till July or August, when they are fit for use.

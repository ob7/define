[1]invective

   INVEC'TIVE, n. [L. inveho. See Inveigh.] A railing speech or
   expression; something uttered or written, intended to cast opprobrium,
   censure or reproach on another; a harsh or reproachful accusation. It
   differs from reproof, as the latter may come from a friend and be
   intended to the good of the person reproved; but invective proceeds
   from an enemy, and is intended to give pain or to injure.

   INVEC'TIVE, a. Satirical; abusive; railing.

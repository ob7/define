[1]do

   DO, v.t. or auxiliary; pret. Did; pp. Done, pronounced dun. This verb,
   when transitive, is formed in the indicative, present tense, thus, I
   do, thou doest, he does or doth; when auxiliary, the second person is,
   thou dost. [G.]

   1. To perform; to execute; to carry into effect; to exert labor or
   power for brining any thing to the state desired, or to completion; or
   to bring any thing to pass. We say, this man does his work well; he
   does more in one day than some men will do in two days.

   In six days thou shalt do all thy work. Exodus 20.

   I will teach you what ye shall do. Exodus 4.

   I the Lord do all these things. Isaiah 45.

   2. To practice; to perform; as, to do good or evil.

   3. To perform for the benefit or injury of another; with for or to;
   for, when the thing is beneficial; to, in either case.

   Till I know what God will do for me. 1 Samuel 22.

   Do to him neither good nor evil. But to is more generally omitted. Do
   him neither good nor harm.

   4. To execute; to discharge; to convey; as, do a message to the king.

   5. To perform; to practice; to observe.

   We lie and do not the truth. 1 John 1.

   6. To exert.

   Do thy diligence to come shortly to me. 2 Timothy 4.

   7. To transact; as, to do business with another.

   8. To finish; to execute or transact and bring to a conclusion. The
   sense of completion is often implied in this verb; as, we will do the
   business and adjourn; we did the business and dined.

   9. To perform in an exigency; to have recourse to, as a consequential
   or last effort; to take a step or measure; as, in this crisis, we knew
   not what to do.

   What will ye do in the day of visitation. Isaiah 10.

   10. To make or cause.

   Nothing but death can do me to respire.

   11. To put.

   Who should do the duke to death?

   12. To answer the purpose.

   Ill make the songs of Durfy do.

   To have to do, to have concern with.

   What have I to do with you? 2 Samuel 16.

   What have I to do any more with idols? Hosea 14.

   To do with, to dispose of; to make use of; to employ. Commerce is dull;
   we know not what to do with our ships. Idle men know not what to do
   with their time or with themselves. Also, to gain; to effect by
   influence.

   A jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow who never had the ache in
   his shoulders.

   I can do nothing with this obstinate fellow.

   Also, to have concern with; to have business; to deal. [See No. 12.]

   To do away, to remove; to destroy; as, to do away imperfections; to do
   away prejudices.

                                  DO, v.i.

   1. To act or behave, in any manner, well or ill; to conduct ones self.

   They fear not the Lord, neither do they after the law and commandment.
   2 Kings 17.

   2. To fare; to be in a state with regard to sickness or health.

   How dost thou?

   We asked him how he did. How do you do, or how do you?

   3. To succeed; to accomplish a purpose. We shall do without him. Will
   this plan do? Also, to fit; to be adapted; to answer the design; with
   for; as, this piece of timber will do for the corner post; this tenon
   will do for the mortise; the road is repaired and will do for the
   present.

   To have to do with, to have concern or business with; to deal with.
   Have little to do with jealous men. Also, to have carnal commerce with.

   Do is used for a verb to save the repetition of it. I shall probably
   come, but if I do not, you must not wait; that is, if I do not come, if
   I come not.

   Do is also used in the imperative, to express an urgent request or
   command; as, do come; help me, do; make haste, do. In this case, do is
   uttered with emphasis.

   As an auxiliary, do is used in asking questions. Do you intend to go?
   Does he wish me to come?

   Do is also used to express emphasis. She is coquetish, but still I do
   love her.

   Do is sometimes a mere expletive.

   This just reproach their virtue does excite.

   Expletives their feeble aid do join.

   [The latter use of do is nearly obsolete.]

   Do is sometimes used by way of opposition; as, I did love him, but he
   has lost my affections.

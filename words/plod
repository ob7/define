   PLOD, v.i. To travel or work slowly or with steady laborious diligence.

   A plodding diligence brings us sooner to our journey's end, than a
   fluttering way of advancing by starts.

   Some stupid, plodding, money-loving wight.

   1. To study heavily with steady diligence.

   2. To toil; to drudge.

     CALCULATE, v.i. To make a computation; as, we calculate better for

   In popular use, this word is often equivalent to intend or purpose,
   that is, to make arrangements, and form a plan; as, a man calculated to
   go a journey. This use of the word springs from the practice of
   computing or estimating the various circumstances which concur to
   influence the mind in forming its determinations.

[1]flour

   FLOUR, n. [originally flower; L. flos, floris, from floreo, to
   flourish.]

   The edible part of corn; meal. In the United States, the modern
   practice is to make a distinction between flour and meal; the word
   flour being more usually applied to the finer part of meal, separated
   from the bran, as wheat flour, rye flour. This is a just and useful
   distinction.

                                 FLOUR, v.t.

   1. To grind and bolt; to convert into flour. Wheat used formerly to be
   sent to market; but now great quantities of it are floured in the
   interior country.

   2. To sprinkle with flour.

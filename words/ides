[1]ides

   IDES, n. plu. [L. idus.] In the ancient Roman calendar, eight days in
   each month; the first day of which fell on the 13th of January,
   February, April, June, August, September, November and December, and on
   the 15th of March, May, July,and October. The ides came between the
   calends and the nones, and were reckoned backwards. This method of
   reckoning is still retained in the chancery of Rome,and in the calendar
   of the breviary.

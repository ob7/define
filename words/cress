   CRESS, n. [G., L.] The name of several species of plants, most of them
   of the class tetradynamia. Watercresses, of the genus Sisymbrium, are
   used as a salad, and are valued in medicine for their antiscorbutic
   qualities. The leaves have a moderately pungent taste. They grow on the
   brinks of rivulets and in other moist grounds. The word is generally
   used in the plural.

   DAZ'ZLING, ppr. Rendering unsteady or wavering as the sight;
   overpowering by a strong light; striking with splendor.

   DAZ'ZLINGLY, adv. In a dazzling manner.

   DE, a Latin prefix, denotes a moving from, separation; as in debark,
   decline, decease, deduct, decamp. Hence it often expresses a negative;
   as in derange. Sometimes it augments the sense, as in deprave, despoil.
   It coincides nearly in sense with the French des and L. dis.

   DE'ACON, n. [Gr., a minister or servant.]

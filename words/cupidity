[1]cupidity

   CUPIDITY, n. [L., to desire, to covet.] An eager desire to possess
   something; an ardent wishing or longing; inordinate or unlawful desire
   of wealth or power. It is not used, I believe, for the animal appetite,
   like lust or concupiscence, but for desire of the mind.

   No property is secure when it becomes large enough to tempt the
   cupidity of indigent power.

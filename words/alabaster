   AL'ABASTER, n. [L. from Gr.]

   A sub-variety of carbonate of lime, found in large masses, formed by
   the deposition of calcarious particles in caverns of limestone rocks.

   odoriferous liquors were kept; so called from the stone of which it was
   made. Also, the name of a measure, containing ten ounces of wine or
   nine of oil.

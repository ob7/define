   RECOLLEC'TION, n.

   1. The act of recalling to the memory, as ideas that have escaped; or
   the operation by which ideas that have escaped; or the operation by
   which ideas are recalled to the memory or revived in the mind.
   Recollection differs from remembrance, as it is the consequence of
   volition, or an effort of the mind to revive ideas; whereas remembrance
   implies no such volition. We often remember things without any
   voluntary effort. Recollection is called also reminiscence.

   2. The power of recalling ideas to the mind, or the period within which
   things can be recollected; remembrance. The events mentioned are not
   within my recollection.

   3. In popular language, recollection is used as synonymous with
   remembrance.

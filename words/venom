   come. See Venus, &c.]

   1. Poison; matter fatal or injurious to life. Venom is generally used
   to express noxious matter that is applied externally, or that is
   discharged from animals, as that of bites and stings of serpents,
   scorpions, &c.; and poison, to express substances taken into the
   stomach.

   2. Spite; malice.

   VEN'OM, v.t. To poison; to infect with venom. [Little used, but envenom
       is in use and elegant. Venom may be elegantly used in poetry.]

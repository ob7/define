   FORM, n. [L. forma.]

   1. The shape or external appearance of a body; the figure, as defined
   by lines and angles; that manner of being peculiar to each body, which
   exhibits it to the eye as distinct from every other body. Thus we speak
   of the form of a circle, the form of a square or triangle, a circular
   form, the form of the head or of the human body, a handsome form, an
   ugly form, a frightful form.

   Matter is the basis or substratum of bodies, form is the particular
   disposition of matter in each body which distinguishes its appearance
   from that of every other body.

   AP'OLOGUE, n. ap'olog. [Gr. a long speech, a fable.]

   A moral fable; a story or relation of fictitious events, intended to
   convey useful truths. An apologue differs from a parable in this; the
   parable is drawn from events which pass among mankind, and is therefore
   supported by probability; an apologue may be founded on supposed
   actions of brutes or inanimate things, and therefore does not require
   to be supported by probability. Esop's fables are good examples of
   apologues.

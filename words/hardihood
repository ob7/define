[1]hardihood

   H`ARDIHOOD, n. [See Hardy and Hood.] Boldness, united with firmness and
   constancy of mind; dauntless bravery; intrepidity.

   It is the society of numbers which gives hardihood to

                                  iniquity.

      Hardihead and hardiment, in the sense of hardihood, are obsolete.

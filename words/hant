   Hanse Towns. Hanse signifies a society; Goth. hansa, a multitude. The
   Hanse towns in Germany were certain commercial cities which associated
   for the protection of commerce as early as the twelfth century. To this
   confederacy acceded certain commercial cities in Holland, England,
   France, Spain and Italy, until they amounted to seventy two, and for
   centuries, this confederacy commanded the respect and defied the power
   of kings. This confederacy at present consists of the cities of Lubeck,
   Hamburg, and Bremen.

   ANAL'OGY, n. [Gr. ratio, proportion.]

   1. an agreement or likeness between things in some circumstances or
   effects, when the things are otherwise entirely different. Thus a plant
   is said to have life, because its growth resembles in some degree, that
   of an animal. In life and growth, then, there is an analogy between a
   plant and an animal. Learning enlightens the mind, because it is to the
   mind, what light is to the eye, enabling it to discover things before
   hidden. When the things which have an analogy follow a preposition,
   that preposition must be between or betwixt; as there is an analogy
   between plants and animals, or between customs. When one of the things
   precedes a verb, and the other follows, the preposition used must be to
   or with; as, a plant has some analogy to or with an animal.

   2. With grammarians, analogy is a conformity of words to the genius,
   structure or general rules of a language. Thus the general rule in
   English is that the plural of a noun ends in es; therefore all nouns
   which have that plural termination have an analogy, or are formed in
   analogy with other words of a like kind.

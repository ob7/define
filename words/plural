[1]plural

   PLU'RAL, a. [L. pluralis, from plus, pluris, more.]

   1. Containing more than one; consisting of two or more, or designating
   two or more; as a plural word.

   2. In grammar, the plural number is that which designates more than
   one, that is, any number except one. Thus in most languages, a word in
   the plural number expresses two or more. But the Greek has a dual
   number to express two; and the plural expresses more than two.

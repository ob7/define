   POOL, n. [L. palus; Gr. probably from setting, standing, like L.
   stagnum, or from issuing, as a spring.]

   A small collection of water in a hollow place, supplied by a spring,
   and discharging its surplus water by an outlet. It is smaller than a
   lake, and in New England is never confounded with pond or lake. It
   signifies with us, a spring with a small basin or reservoir on the
   surface of the earth. It is used by writers with more latitude, and
   sometimes signifies a body of stagnant water.

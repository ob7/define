   REPUBLICA'TION, n. [re and publication.]

   1. A second publication, or a new publication of something before
   published.

   2. A second publication, as of a former will, renewal.

   If there be many testaments, the last overthrows all the former; but
   the republication of a former will, revokes one of a later date, and
   establishes the first.

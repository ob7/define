[1]tuf

   TUF, n. A stone or porous substance formed by depositions from springs
   or rivulets, containing much earthy matter in solution. Tufa is also
   formed by the concretion of loose volcanic dust or cinders, cemented by
   water, or by the consolidation of mud thrown out of volcanoes. The
   disintegration and subsequent consolidation of basaltic rocks, forms a
   kind of tufa, called by the German geologists, trap-tuff.

   SOUTH, n.

   1. The north and south are opposite points in the horizon; each ninety
   degrees or the quarter of a great circle distant from the east and
   west. A man standing with his face towards the east or rising sun, has
   the south on his right hand. The meridian of every place is a great
   circle passing through the north and south points. Strictly, south is
   the horizontal point in the meridian of a place, on the right hand of a
   person standing with his face towards the east. But the word is applied
   to any point in the meridian, between the horizon and the zenith.

   2. In a less exact sense, any point or place on the earth or in the
   heavens, which is near the meridian towards the right hand as one faces
   the east.

   3. A southern region, country or place; as the queen of the south, in
   Scriptures. So in Europe, the people of Spain and Italy are spoken of
   as living in the south. In the United States, we speak of the states of
   the south, and of the north.

   4. The wind that blows from the north. [Not used.]

                                  SOUTH, a.

   1. In any place north of the tropic of Cancer, pertaining to or lying
   in the meridian towards the sun; as a south wind.

   2. Being in a southern direction; as the south sea.

      SOUTH, adv. Towards the south. A ship sails south; the wind blows
                                   south.

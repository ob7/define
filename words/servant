   SERV'ANT, [L. servans, from servo, to keep or hold; properly one that
   waits, that is, stops, holds, attends, or one that is bound.]

   1. A person, male or female, that attends another for the pupose of
   performing menial offices for him, ot who is employed by another for
   such offices or for other labor, and is subject to his command. The
   word is correlative to master. Servant differs from slave, as the
   servant's subjection to a master is voluntary, the slave's is not.
   Every slave is a servant, but every servant is not a slave.

   Servants are of various kinds; as household or domestic servants,
   menial servants; laborers, who are hired by the day, week or other
   term, and do not reside with their employers, ot if they board in the
   same house, are employed abroad and not in the domestic services;
   apprentices, who are bound for a term of years to serve a master, for
   the purpose of learning his trade or occupation.

   In a legal sense, stewards, factors, bailifs and other agents, are
   servants for the time they are employed in such character, as they act
   in subordination to others.

   2. One in a state of subjection.

   3.In Scripture, a slave; a bondman; one purchased for money, and who
   was compelled to serve till the year of jubilee; also, one purchased
   for a term of years.

   4. The subject of a king; as the servents of David or of Saul.

   The Syrians became servants to David. 2 Sam. 8.

   5. A person who voluntarily serves another or acts as his minister; as
   joshua was the servant of Moses, and the apostles the apostles the
   servants of Christ. So Christ himself is called a servant, Is. 42.
   Moses is called the servant of the Lord, Duet. 34.

   6. A person employed or used as an unstrument in accomplishing God's
   purposes of mercy or wrath. So Nebuchadnezzar is called the servant of
   God. Jer. 25.

   7. One who yields obedience to another. The saints are called servants
   of God, or of righteousness; and the wicked are called the servants of
   sin.

   8. That which yields obedience, or acts on subordination as an
   instrument.

   9. One that makes painful sacrifices in compliance with the weakness or
   wants of others.

   10. A person of base condition or ignoble spirit.

   11. A word of civilith. I am, sir, your humble or obedient servant.

   Our betters tell us they are our humble servants, but understand us to
   be their slaves. Swift.

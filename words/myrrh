   MYRRH, n. mer. [L. myrrha.] A gum-resin that comes in the form of drops
   or globules of various colors and sizes, of a pretty strong but
   agreeable smell, and of a bitter taste. It is imported from Egypt, but
   chiefly from the southern or eastern parts of Arabia; from what species
   of tree or plant it is procured, is unknown. As a medicine, it is a
   good stomachic, antispasmodic and cordial.

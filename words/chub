   CHUB, n. A river fish, called also cheven, of the genus Cyprinus. The
   body is oblong, nearly round; the head and back, green; the sides
   silvery, and the belly white. It frequents deep holes in rivers shaded
   by trees; but in warm weather floats near the surface, and furnishes
   sport for anglers. It is indifferent food.

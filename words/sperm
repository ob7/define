   SPERM, n. [L. sperma.]

   1. Animal seed; that by which the species is propagated.

   2. The head matter of a certain species of whale, called cachalot. It
   is called by the French blanc de baleine, the white of whales. It is
   found also in other parts of the body; but it is improperly named, not
   being a spermatic substance. Of this matter are mad candles of a
   beautiful white color.

   3. Spawn of fishes or frogs.

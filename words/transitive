   TRANS'ITIVE, a. Having the power of passing.

   1. In grammar, a transitive verb is one which is or may be followed by
   an object; a verb expressing an action which passes from the agent to
   an object, from the subject which does, to the object on which it is
   done. Thus, "Cicero wrote letters to Atticus." In this sentence,the act
   of writing, performed by Cicero, the agent, terminates on letters, the
   object. All verbs not passive, may be arranged in two classes,
   transitive and intransitive. In English, this division is correct and
   complete.

   COTTON-PLANT, COTTON-SHRUB, n. A plant or shrub of the genus Gossypium,
   of several species, all growing in warm climates. The principal species
   are, 1. The herbaceous cotton, with smooth leaves and yellow flowers,
   succeeded by roundish capsules, full of seeds and cotton; 2. The hairy
   American cotton, with hairy stalks and leaves, and yellow flowers
   succeeded by oval pods; 3. The Barbadoes shrubby cotton, has a shrubby
   stalk, yellow flowers and oval pods; 4. The arboreum or tree cotton,
   with a woody perennial stalk, bears yellow flowers and large pods. The
   first three species are annual plants; the last is perennial.

   In the southern states of America, the cotton cultivated is
   distinguished into three kinds; the nankeen cotton, so called from its
   color; the green seed cotton, producing white cotton with green seeds.
   These grow in the middle and upper country, and are called short staple
   cotton. The black seed cotton, cultivated in the lower country near the
   sea, and on the isles near the shore, produces cotton of a fine, white,
   silky appearance, very strong and of a long staple. The seeds of the
   long staple cotton are separated by roller-gins. The seeds of the short
   staple cotton are separated with more difficulty, by a sawgin invented
   by E. Whitney.

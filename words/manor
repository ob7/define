[1]manor

   MAN'OR, n. [L. maneo, to abide.] The land belonging to a lord or
   nobleman, or so much land as a lord or great personage formerly kept in
   his own hands for the use and subsistence of his family. In these
   days,a manor rather signifies the jurisdiction and royalty
   incorporeal,than the land or site; for a man may have a manor in gross,
   as the law terms it, that is, the right and interest of a court-baron,
   with the perquisites thereto belonging.

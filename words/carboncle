   CARBONCLE, n.

   1. An anthrax; an inflammatory tumor, or painful gangrenous boil or
   ulcer.

   2. A beautiful gem, of a deep red color, with a mixture of scarlet,
   called by the Greeks anthrax, found in the East Indies. It is
   foundpure, and adhering to a heavy ferruginous stone, of the emery
   kind. It is usually a quarter of an inch in length, and two-thirds of
   that in diameter, of an angular figure. When held up to the sun, it
   loses its deep tinge, and becomes exactly of the color of a burning
   coal.

   The carbuncle of the ancients is supposed to have been a garnet.

   3. In heraldry, a charge or bearing consisting of eight radii, four of
   which make a common cross, and the other four, a saltier.

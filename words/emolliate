[1]emolliate

   EMOL'LIATE, v.t. [L. emollio, mollio, to soften; mollis, soft; Eng.
   mellow, mild.]

   To soften; to render effeminate.

   Emolliated by four centuries of Roman domination, the Belgic colonies
   had forgotten their pristine valor.

        [This is a new word, though well formed and applied; but what
   connection is there between softening and forgetting? Lost is here the
                         proper word for forgotten.]

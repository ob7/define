[1]plague

   PLAGUE, n. plag. [L. plaga, a stroke; Gr. See Lick and Lay. The primary
   sense is a stroke or striking. So afflict is from the root of flog, and
   probably of the same family as plague.]

   1. Any thing troublesome or vexatious; but in this sense, applied to
   the vexations we suffer from men, and not to the unavoidable evils
   inflicted on us by Divine Providence. The application of the word to
   the latter, would now be irreverent and reproachful.

   2. A pestilential disease; an acute, malignant and contagious disease
   that often prevails in Egypt, Syria and Turkey, and has at times
   infected the large cities of Europe with frightful mortality.

   3. A state of misery. Ps.38.

   4. Any great natural evil or calamity; as the ten plagues of Egypt.

                             PLAGUE, v.t. plag.

   1. To infest with disease, calamity or natural evil of any kind.

   Thus were they plagued

   And worn with famine.

   2. To vex; to tease; to harass; to trouble; to embarrass; a very
   general and indefinite signification.

   If her nature be so,

   That she will plague the man that loves her most--

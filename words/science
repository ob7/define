   SCI'ENCE, n. [L. scientia, from scio, to know.]

   1. In a general sense, knowledge, or certain knowledge; the
   comprehension or understanding of truth or facts by the mind. The
   science of God must be perfect.

   2. In philosophy, a collection of the general principles or leading
   truths relating to any subject. Pure science, as the mathematics, is
   built on self-evident truths; but the term science is also applied to
   other subjects founded on generally acknowledged truths, as
   metaphysics; or on experiment and observation, as chimistry and natural
   philosophy; or even to an assemblage of the general principles of an
   art, as the science of agriculture; the science of navigation. Arts
   relate to practice, as painting and sculpture.

   A principle in science is a rule in art.

   3. Art derived from precepts or built on principles.

   Science perfects genius.

   4. Any art or species of knowledge.

   No science doth make known the first principles on which it buildeth.

   5. One of the seven liberal branches of knowledge, viz grammar, logic,
   rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music.

   [Note - Authors have not always been careful to use the terms art and
   science with due discrimination and precision. Music is an art as well
   as a science. In general, an art is that which depends on practice or
   performance, and science that which depends on abstract or speculative
   principles. The theory of music is a science; the practice of it an
   art.]

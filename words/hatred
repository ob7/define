   HA'TRED, n. Great dislike or aversion; hate; enmity. Hatred is an
   aversion to evil, and may spring from utter disapprobation, as the
   hatred of vice or meanness; or it may spring from offenses or injuries
   done by fellow men, or from envy or jealousy, in which case it is
   usually accompanied with malevolence or malignity. Extreme hatred is
   abhorrence or detestation.

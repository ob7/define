   MAC'ERATE, v.t. [L. macero, from macer, thin, lean; maceo, to be thin
   or lean; Eng. meager, meek.]

   1. To make lean; to wear away.

   2. To mortify; to harass with corporeal hardships; to cause to pine or
   waste away.

   Out of excessive zeal they macerate their bodies and impair their
   health.

   3. To steep almost to solution; to soften and separate the parts of a
   substance by steeping it in a fluid, or by the digestive process. So we
   say, food is macerated in the stomach.

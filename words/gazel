   GAZ'EL, n. An animal of Africa and India, of the genus Antilope. It
   partakes of the nature of the goat and the deer. Like the goat, the
   gazel has hollow permanent horns, and it feeds on shrubs; but in size
   and delicacy, and in the nature and color of its hair, it resembles the
   roe-buck. It has cylindrical horns, most frequently annulated at the
   base, and bunches of hair on its fore legs. It has a most brilliant,
   beautiful eye.

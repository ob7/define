[1]insect

   IN'SECT, n. [L. insecta, plu.,from inseco, to cut in; in and seco, to
   cut. This name seems to have been originally given to certain small
   animals whose bodies appear cut in, or almost divided.]

   1. In zoology, a small invertebral animal, breathing by lateral
   spiracles, and furnished with articulated extremities and movable
   antennae. Most insects pass through three states or metamorphoses, the
   larva, the chrysalis,and the perfect insect.

     The class of insects, in the Linnean system, is divided into seven
      orders, the last of which [Aptera] includes the Crustacea, which
      breathe by gills, and the Arachnids, which have no antennae, now
                        forming two distinct classes.

   The term insect has been applied,but improperly, to other small
   invertebral animals of the Linnean class Vermes.

   2. Any thing small or contemptible.

                   IN'SECT, a. Small; mean; contemptible.

[1]fleece

   FLEECE, n. flees. [L. vellus, from vello, to pluck or tear off.]

   The coat of wool shorn from a sheep at one time.

                                FLEECE, v.t.

   1. To shear off a covering or growth of wool.

   2. To strip of money or property; to take from, by severe exactions,
   under color of law or justice, or pretext of necessity, or by virtue of
   authority. Arbitrary princes fleece their subjects; and clients
   complain that they are sometimes fleeced by their lawyers.

   This word is rarely or never used for plundering in war by a licentious
   soldiery; but is properly used to express a stripping by contributions
   levied on a conquered people.

   3. To spread over as with wool; to make white.

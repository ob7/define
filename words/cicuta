[1]cicuta

   CICUTA, n. Water-hemlock, a plant whose root is poisonous. This term
   was used by the ancients and by medical writers for the Conium
   maculatum, or common hemlock, the expressed juice of which was used as
   a common poison. Socrates and Phocion perished by it. It is now used
   medicinally in moderate doses, with good effect.

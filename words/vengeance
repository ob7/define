[1]vengeance

   VENGEANCE, n. venj'ance. [L. vindico.]

   The infliction of pain on another, in return for an injury or offense.
   Such infliction, when it proceeds from malice or more resentment, and
   is not necessary for the purposes of justice, is revenge, and a most
   heinous crime. When such infliction proceeds from a mere love of
   justice, and the necessity of punishing offenders for the support of
   the laws, it is vengeance, and is warrantable and just. In this case,
   vengeance is a just retribution, recompense or punishment. In this
   latter sense the word is used in Scripture, and frequently applied to
   the punishments inflicted by God on sinners.

   To me belongeth vengeance and recompense. Deut. 32.

   The Lord will take vengeance on his adversaries. Nah. 1.

   With a vengeance, in familiar language, signifies with great violence
   or vehemence; as, to strike one with a vengeance.

   Formerly, what a vengeance, was a phrase used for what emphatical.

   But what a vengeance makes thee fly?

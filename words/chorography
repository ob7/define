[1]chorography

   CHOROGRAPHY, n. The art or practice of making a map of a particular
   region, country, or province; or of marking its limits, bounds or
   position. Chorography differs from geography, as the description of a
   particular country differs from that of the whole earth; and from
   topography, as the description of a country differs from that of a
   town, city or district.

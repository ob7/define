[1]vehicle

   VE'HICLE, n. [L. vehiculum, from veho, to carry.]

   1. That in which any thing is or may be carried; any kind of carriage
   moving on land, either on wheels or runners. This word comprehends
   coaches, chariots, gigs, sullies, wagons, carts of every kind, sleighs
   and sleds. These are all vehicles. But the word is more generally
   applied to wheel carriages, and rarely I believe to water craft.

   2. That which is used as the instrument of conveyance. Language is the
   vehicle which conveys ideas to others. Letters are vehicles of
   communication.

   A simple style forms the best vehicle of thought to a popular assembly.

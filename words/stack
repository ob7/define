   STACK, n.

   1. A large conical pile of hay, grain or straw, sometimes covered with
   thatch. In America, the stack differs from the cock only in size, both
   being conical. A long pile of hay or grain is called a rick. In
   England, this distinction is not always observed. This word in Great
   Britain is sometimes applied to a pile of wood containing 108 cubic
   feet, and also to a pile of poles; but I believe never in America.

   Against every pillar was a stack of billets above a mans highth.

   2. A number of funnels or chimneys standing together. We say, a stack
   of chimneys; which is correct, as a chimney is a passage. But we also
   call the whole stack a chimney. Thus we say, the chimney rises ten feet
   above the roof.

                                 STACK, v.t.

   1. To lay in a conical or other pile; to make into a large pile; as, to
   stack hay or grain.

   2. In England, to pile wood, poles, &c.

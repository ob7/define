[1]bigamy

   BIG'AMY, n. [L.bis,twice, and Gr. to marry, marriage.]

   The crime of having two wives at once. But the term is ordinarily used
   as synonymous with Polygamy, and may be more justly defined, the crime
   of having a plurality of wives.

   In the canon law, bigamy was the marrying a second wife after the death
   of the first, or once marrying a widow. This disqualified a man for
   orders,and holding ecclesiastical offices.

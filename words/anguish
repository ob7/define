[1]anguish

   AN'GUISH, n. [L. angustia, narrowness, from pressure. See Anger.]

   Extreme pain, either of body or mind. As bodily pain, it may differ
   from agony, which is such distress of the whole body as to cause
   contortion, whereas anguish may be a local pain as of an ulcer, or
   gout. But anguish and agony are nearly synonymous. As pain of the mind,
   it signifies any keen distress from sorrow, remorse, despair and
   kindred passions.

   And they hearkened not to Moses, for anguish of spirit, and for cruel
   bondage. Ex. 6.

           AN'GUISH, v.t. To distress with extreme pain or grief.

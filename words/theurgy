[1]theurgy

   THE'URGY, n. [Gr. God, and work.] The art of doing things which it is
   the peculiar province of God to do; or the power or act of performing
   supernatural things by invoking the names of God or of subordinate
   agents; magic. This has been divided by some writers into three parts;
   theurgy, or the operation by divine or celestial means; natural magic,
   performed by the powers of nature; and necromancy, which proceeds by
   invoking demons.

   throw out with a sudden effort.]

   1. To thrust out; to thrust with a sudden effort; to give a sudden
   pull, twitch, thrust or push, as, to jerk one under the ribs; to jerk
   one with the elbow.

   this word to express the mode of throwing to a little distance by
   drawing the arm back of the body, and thrusting it forward against the
   side or hip, which stops the arm suddenly.

                 JERK, v.t. To accost eagerly. [Not in use.]

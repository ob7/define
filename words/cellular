   CELLULAR, a. Consisting of cells, or containing cells.

   The cellular membrane, in animal bodies, is composed of an infinite
   number of minute cells, communicating with each other. It invests every
   fiber, and seems to be the medium of connection between all parts of
   the body. The cells serve as reservoirs for fat.

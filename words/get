[1]get

   GET, v.t. pret. got. [gat, obs.] pp. got, gotten.

   1. To procure; to obtain; to gain possession of, by almost any means.
   We get favor by kindness; we get wealth by industry and economy; we get
   land by purchase; we get praise by good conduct; and we get blame by
   doing injustice. The merchant should get a profit on his goods; the
   laborer should get a due reward for his labor; most men get what they
   can for their goods or for their services. Get differs from acquire, as
   it does not always express permanence of possession, which is the
   appropriate sense of acquire. We get a book or a loaf of bread by
   borrowing, we do not acquire it; but we get or acquire an estate.

   2. To have.

   Thou hast got the face of a man.

   This is a most common, but gross abuse of this word. We constantly hear
   it said, I have got no corn, I have got no money, she has got a fair
   complexion, when the person means only, I have no corn, I have no
   money, she has a fair complexion.

   3. To beget; to procreate; to generate.

   4. To learn; as, to get a lesson.

   5. To prevail on; to induce; to persuade.

   Though the king could not get him to engage in a life of business.
   [This is not elegant.]

   6. To procure to be. We could not get the work done. [Not elegant.]

   To get off, to put off; to take or pull off; as, to get off a garment:
             also,to remove; as, to get off a ship from shoals.

   To sell; to dispose of; as, to get off goods.

   To get on, to put on; to draw or pull on; as, to get on a coat; to get
                                  on boots.

   To get in, to collect and shelter; to bring under cover; as, to get in
                                    corn.

             To get out, to draw forth; as, to get out a secret.

   To draw out; to disengage.

          To get the day, to win; to conquer; to gain the victory.

       as, to get over difficulties: also, to recover; as, to get over
                                  sickness.

                   To get above, to surmount; to surpass.

    To get up, to prepare and introduce upon the stage; to bring forward.

   With a pronoun following, it signifies to betake; to remove; to go; as,
    get you to bed; get thee out of the land. But this mode of expression
                        can hardly be deemed elegant.

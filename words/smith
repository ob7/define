[1]smith

   SMITH, n.

   1. Literally, the striker, the beater; hence, one who forges with the
   hammer; one who works in metals; as an iron-smith; gold-smith;
   silver-smith, &c. Nor yet the smith hath learn'd to form a sword.

   2. He that makes or effects any thing.

     Hence the name Smith, which, from the number of workmen employed in
    working metals in early ages, is supposed to be more common than any
                                   other.

           SMITH, v.t. To beat into shape; to forge. [Not in use.]

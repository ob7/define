   BAT, n. [I have not found this word in any European language, except in
                                  English.]

     A race of quadrupeds, technically called Vespertilio, of the order
   primates, in Linne's system. The fore feet have the toes connected by a
   membrane, expanded into a kind of wings, by means of which the animals
     fly. The species are numerous. Of these, the vampire or Ternate bat
     inhabits Africa and the Oriental Isles. These animals fly in flocks
   from isle to isle, obscuring the sun by their numbers. Their wings when
    extended measure five or six feet. They live on fruits; but are said
      sometimes to draw blood from persons when asleep. The bats of the
     northern latitudes are small; they are viviparous and suckle their
      young. Their skin resembles that of a mouse. They enter houses in
      pleasant summer evenings, feed upon moths, flies, flesh, and oily
                substances, and are torpid during the winter.

   PLOT, n. [a different orthography of plat.]

   1. A plat or small extent of ground; as a garden plot.

   It was a chosen plot of fertile land.

   When we mean to build,

   We first survey the plot.

   2. A plantation laid out.

   3. A plan or scheme. [Qu. the next word.]

   4. In surveying, a plan or draught of a field, farm or manor surveyed
   and delineated on paper.

                                  PLOT, n.

   1. Any scheme, stratagem or plan of a complicated nature, or consisting
   of many parts, adapted to the accomplishment of some purpose, usually a
   mischievous one. A plot may be formed by a single person or by numbers.
   In the latter case, it is a conspiracy or an intrigue. The latter word
   more generally denotes a scheme directed against individuals; the
   former against the government. But this distinction is not always
   observed.

   O think what anxious moments pass between

   The birth of plots, and their last fatal periods!

   2. In dramatic writings, the knot or intrigue; the story of a play,
   comprising a complication of incidents which are at last unfolded by
   unexpected means.

   If the plot or intrigue must be natural, and such as springs from the
   subject, the winding up of the plot must be a probable consequence of
   all that went before.

   3. Contrivance; deep reach of thought; ability to plot.

   A man of much plot.

    PLOT, v.i. To form a scheme of mischief against another, or against a

   The prince did plot to be secretly gone.

   PLOT, v.t. To plan; to devise; to contrive; as, to plot an unprofitable

[1]assimilation

   ASSIMILA'TION, n.

   1. The act of bringing to a resemblance.

   2. The act or process by which bodies convert other bodies into their
   own nature and substance; as, flame assimilates oil, and the food of
   animals is by assimilation converted into the substances which compose
   their bodies.

   Mineral assimilation is the property which substances possess, in the
   earth, of appropriating and assimilating to themselves other substances
   with which they are in contact; a property which seems to be the basis
   of the natural history of the earth.

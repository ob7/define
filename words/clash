   CLASH, v.i.

   1. To strike against; to drive against with force.

   Note. The sense of this word is simply to strike against or meet with
   force; but when two sounding bodies strike together, the effect is a
   sound. Hence the word often implies, to strike with a noise, as
   clashing arms.

   2. To meet in opposition; to be contrary; to act in a contrary
   direction; to interfere, as opposing persons, minds, views, interests,
   &c.; as, the opinions of men clash; clashing interests.

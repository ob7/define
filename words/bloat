[1]bloat

   BLOAT, v.t.[This word may be allied to bladder, from the sense of
   inflating, swelling.]

   1. To swell or make turgid, as with air; to inflate; to puff up; hence,
   to make vain; followed by up, but without necessity. To bloat up with
   praise is less elegant than to bloat with praise.

   2. To swell or make turgid with water, or other means; as a bloated
   limb. It is used to denote a morbid enlargement, often accompanied with
   softness.

                   BLOAT, v.i. To grow turgid; to dilate.

                   BLOAT, a. Swelled; turgid. [Not used.]

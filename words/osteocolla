   OSTEOCOL'LA, n. [Gr. a bone, and glue.] A carbonate of lime, a fossil
   formed by incrustation on the stem of a plant. It is found in long,
   thick, and irregular cylindric pieces, generally hollow, sometimes
   filled with calcarious earth, and in size, from that of a crow's quill
   to that of a man's arm. It is always found in sand.

   That word takes its name from an opinion that it has the quality of
   uniting fractured bones.

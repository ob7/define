[1]alleviate

   ALLE'VIATE, v.t. [Low L. allevio; ad and levo, to raise, levis, light.]

   1. To make light; but always in a figurative sense, as it is not
   applied to material objects. To remove in part; to lessen, mitigate, or
   make easier to be endured; applied to evils; as, to alleviate sorrow,
   pain, care, punishment, a burden, &c.; opposed to aggravate.

   2. To make less by representation; to lessen the magnitude or
   criminality; to extenuate; applied to moral conduct; as, to alleviate
   an offense. [This sense of the word is rare.]

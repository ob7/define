   ANTECE'DENT, n. That which goes before in time; hence in writings, that
   which precedes in place. In grammar, the noun to which a relative or
   other substitute refers; as, Solomon was the prince, who built the
   Temple. In logic, the first of two propositions in an enthymeme, or
   argument of two propositions; as, if the sun is fixed, the earth must
   move. Here the first and conditional proposition is the antecedent; the
   second, the consequent.

   compared with the other.

   unctuous feel; a subspecies of rhomboidal mica. It is of two kings, the
   common, and the pagodite or lard-stone. It is sometimes confounded with
   talck, to which its is allied. It is a compact stone, white, green of
   all shades, gray, brown or marbled, and sometimes herborized by black
   dendrites. It is found in metalliferous veins, with the ores of copper,
   lead, zink, silver and tin.

[1]quaint

   QUAINT, a. [The latter word would lead us to refer quaint to the Latin
   accinctus, ready, but Skinner thinks it more probably from comptus,
   neat, well dressed.]

   1. Nice; scrupulously and superfluously exact; having petty elegance;
   as a quaint phrase; a quaint fashion.

   To show how quaint an orator you are.

   2. Subtle; artful. Obs.

   3. Fine-spun; artfully framed.

   4. Affected; as quaint fopperies.

   5. In common use, odd; fanciful; singular; and so used by Chaucer.

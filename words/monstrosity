   MONSTROS'ITY, n. The state of being monstrous, or out of the common
   order of nature.

   We often read of monstrous births; but we see a greater monstrosity in
   education, when a father begets a son and trains him up into a beast.

   1. An unnatural production; that which is monstrous.

   Fabri arranges distortions, gibbosities, tumors, &c. in the class of
   morbific monstrosities.

   A monstrosity never changes the name or affects the immutability of a
   species.

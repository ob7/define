   VERMILION, a. vermil'yon. [L. vermiculus, vermes; a name sometimes
   improperly given to the kermes. See Crimson.]

   1. The cochineal, a small insect found on a particular plant. [Improper
   or obsolete.]

   2. Red sulphuret of mercury; a bright, beautiful red color of two
   sorts, natural and artificial. The natural is found in silver mines, in
   the form of a ruddy sand, which is to be prepared by purification or
   washing, and then levigated with water on a stone. The factitious or
   common vermilion is made of artificial cinnabar, ground with white
   wine, and afterwards with the white of an egg.

   3. Any beautiful red color. In blushing, the delicate cheek is covered
   with vermilion.

    VERMILION, v.t. vermil'yon. To dye red; to cover with a delicate red.

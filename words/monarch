   MON'ARCH, n. [Gr. sole, and a chief.]

   1. The prince or ruler of a nation, who exercises all the powers of
   government without control, or who is vested with absolute sovereign
   power; an emperor, king or prince invested with

          an unlimited power. This is the strict sense of the word.

   2. A king or prince, the supreme magistrate of a nation, whose powers
   are in some respects limited by the constitution of the government.
   Thus we call the king of Great Britain a monarch, although he can make
   no law without the consent of parliament.

   3. He or that which is superior to others of the same kind; as, an oak
   is called the monarch of the forest; a lion the monarch of wild beasts.

   4. One that presides; president; as Bacchus, monarch of the vine.

             MON'ARCH, a. Supreme; ruling; as a monarch savage.

[1]ox

   OX, n. plu. oxen. pron. ox'n.

   The male of the bovine genus of quadrupeds, castrated and grown to his
   size or nearly so. The young male is called in America a steer. The
   same animal not castrated is called a bull. These distinctions are well
   established with us in regard to domestic animals of this genus. When
   we speak of wild animals of this kind, ox is sometimes applied both to
   the male and female, and in zoology, the same practice exists in regard
   to the domestic animals. Sop in common usage, a pair of bulls yoked may
   be sometimes called oxen. We never apply the name ox to the cow or
   female of the domestic kind. Oxen in the plural may comprehend both the
   male and female.

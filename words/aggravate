[1]aggravate

   AG'GRAVATE, v.t. [L. aggravo, of ad and gravis, heavy. See Grave,
   Gravity.]

   1. To make heavy, but not used in this literal sense. Figuratively, to
   make worse, more severe, or less tolerable; as, to aggravate the evils
   of life; to aggravate pain or punishment.

   2. To make more enormous, or less excusable; as, to aggravate a crime.

   3. To exaggerate.

   4. To give coloring in description; to give an exaggerated
   representation; as, to aggravate a charge against an offender; to
   aggravate circumstances.

   The propriety of the word in the latter passage is questionable.
   Aggravate is generally used in reference to evils, or something
   improper or unnatural.

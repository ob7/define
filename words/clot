[1]clot

   CLOT, n. [See Clod.] A concretion, particularly of soft or fluid
   matter, which concretes into a mass or lump; as a clot of blood. Clod
   and clot appear to be radically the same word; but we usually apply
   clod to a hard mass of earth, and clot to a mass of softer substances,
   or fluids concreted.

   CLOT, v.i.

   1. To concrete; to coagulate, as soft or fluid matter into a thick,
   inspissated mass; as milk or blood clots.

   2. To form into clots or clods; to adhere; as, clotted glebe.

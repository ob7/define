[1]dot

   DOT, n. [I know not the origin and affinities of this word. It would be
   naturally deduced from a verb signifying to set, or to prick, like
   punctum, point.] A small point or spot, made with a pen or other
   pointed instrument; a speck; used in marking a writing or other thing.

   DOT, v.t.

   1. To mark with dots.

   2. To mark or diversify with small detached objects; as a landscape
   dotted with cottages, or clumps of trees.

                      DOT, v.i. To make dots or spots.

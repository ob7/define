   MIN'STREL, n. A singer and musical performer on instruments. Minstrels
   were formerly poets as well as musicians, and held in high repute by
   our rude ancestors. Their attendance was sought and their performances
   lavishly rewarded by princes. It was in the character of a minstrel
   that king Alfred entered the camp of the Danes his enemies, and
   explored their situation.

   SUPER'FLUOUS, a. [L. superfluus, overflowing; super and fluo, to flow.]

   1. More than is wanted; rendered unnecessary by superabundance; as a
   superfluous supply of corn.

   2. More than sufficient; unnecessary; useless; as a composition
   abounding with superfluous words. Superfluous epithets rather enfeeble
   than strengthen description. If what has been said will not convince,
   it would be superfluous to say more.

     Superfluous interval, in music, is one that exceeds a true diatonic
                        interval by a semitone minor.

   Superfluous polygamy, (Polygamia superflua,) a kind of inflorescence or
   compound flower, in which the florets of the disk are hermaphrodite and
   fertile, and those of the ray, though female or pistiliferous only, are
    also fertile; designating the second order of the class Syngenesia of
                                   Linne.

   Superfluous sound or tone, is one which contains a semitone minor more
                                than a tone.

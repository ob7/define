[1]calx

   CALX, n. Properly lime or chalk; but more appropriately, the substance
   of a metal or mineral which remains after being subjected to violent
   heat, burning, or calcination, solution by acids, or detonation by
   niter, and which is or may be reduced to a fine powder. Metallic calxes
   are now called oxyds. They are heavier than the metal from which they
   are produced, being combined with oxygen.

   Calx nativa, native calx, a kind of marly earth, of a dead whitish
   color, which, in water, bubbles or hisses, and without burning, will
   make a cement, like lime or gypsum.

   Calx viva, quick-lime, is lime not slaked.

   REFORM', v.t. [L. reformo; re and formo, to form.]

   1. To change from worse to better; to amend; to correct; to restore to
   a former good state, or to bring from a bad to a good state; as, to
   reform a profligate man; to reform corrupt manners or morals.

   The example alone of a vicious prince will corrupt an age, but that of
   a good one will not reform it.

   2. To change from bad to good; to remove that which is bad or corrupt;
   as, to reform abuses; to reform the vices of the age.

   REFORM', v.i. To abandon that which is evil or corrupt, and return to a

                             will seldom reform.

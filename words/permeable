[1]permeable

   PER'MEABLE, a. [L.permeo; per and meo, to pass or glide.]

   That may be passed through without rupture or displacement of its
   parts, as solid matter; applied particularly to substances that admit
   the passage of fluids. Thus cloth, leather, wood are permeable to water
   and oil; glass is permeable to light, but not to water.

   ALEM'BIC, n.

   A chimical vessel used in distillation; usually made of glass or
   copper. The bottom part containing the liquor to be distilled, is
   called the cucurbit; the upper part which receives and condenses the
   stream, is called the head, the beak of which is fitted to the neck of
   a receiver. The head is more properly the alembic. This vessel is not
   so generally used now, as the worm still and retort.

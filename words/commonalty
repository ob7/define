[1]commonalty

   COMMONALTY, n.

   1. The common people. In Great Britain, all classes and conditions of
   people, who are below the rank of nobility.

   The commonalty, like the nobility, are divided into several degrees.

   In the United States, commonalty has no very definite signification. It
   is however used to denote that part of the people who live by labor,
   and are not liberally educated, nor elevated by office or professional
   pursuits.

   2. The bulk of mankind.

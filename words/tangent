[1]tangent

   TAN'GENT, n. [L. tangens, touching. See Touch.]

   In geometry, a right line which touches a curve, but which when
   produced, does not cut it. In trigonometry, the tangent of an arc, is a
   right line touching the arc at one extremity, and terminated by a
   second passing through the other extremity.

   STATE, n. [L., to stand, to be fixed.]

   1. Condition; the circumstances of a being or thing at any given time.
   These circumstances may be internal, constitutional or peculiar to the
   being, or they may have relation to other beings. We say, the body is
   in a sound state, or it is in a weak state; or it has just recovered
   from a feeble state. The state of his health is good. The state of his
   mind is favorable for study. So we say, the state of public affairs
   calls for the exercise of talents and wisdom. In regard to foreign
   nations, our affairs are in a good state. So we say, single state, and
   married state.

   Declare the past and present state of things.

   2. Modification of any thing.

   Keep the state of the question in your eye.

   3. Crisis; stationary point; highth; point from which the next movement
   is regression.

   Tumors have their several degrees and times, as beginning, augment,
   state and declination. [Not in use.]

   4. Estate; possession. [See Estate.]

   5. A political body, or body politic; the whole body of people united
   under one government, whatever may be the form of the government.

   Municipal law is a rule of conduct prescribed by the supreme power in a
   state.

   More usually the word signifies a political body governed by
   representatives; a commonwealth; as the States of Greece; the States of
   America. In this sense, state has sometimes more immediate reference to
   the government, sometimes to the people or community. Thus when we say,
   the state has made provision for the paupers, the word has reference to
   the government or legislature; but when we say, the state is taxed to
   support paupers, the word refers to the whole people or community.

   6. A body of men united by profession, or constituting a community of a
   particular character; as the civil and ecclesiastical states in Great
   Britain. But these are sometimes distinguished by the terms church and
   state. In this case, state signifies the civil community or government
   only.

   7. Rank; condition; quality; as the state of honor.

   8. Pomp; appearance of greatness.

   In state the monarchs marchd.

   Where least of state, there most of love is shown.

   9. Dignity; grandeur.

   She instructed him how he should keep state, yet with a modest sense of
   his misfortunes.

   10. A seat of dignity.

   11. A canopy; a covering of dignity.

   13. The principal persons in a government.

   14. The bodies that constitute the legislature of a country; as the
   states general.

   15. Joined with another word, it denotes public, or what belongs to the
   community or body politic; as state affairs; state policy.

                                 STATE, v.t.

   1. To set; to settle. [See Stated.]

   2. To express the particulars of any thing verbally; to represent fully
   in words; to narrate; to recite. The witnesses stated all the
   circumstances of the transaction. They are enjoined to state all the
   particulars. It is the business of the advocate to state the whole
   case. Let the question be fairly stated.

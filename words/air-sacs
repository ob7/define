   A'IR-SACS, n. Air bags in birds, which are certain receptacles of air,
   or vesicles lodged in the fleshy parts, in the hollow bones and in the
   abdomen, which all communicate with the lungs. These are supposed to
   render the body specifically lighter, and to supply the place of a
   muscular diaphragm.

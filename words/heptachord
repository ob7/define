[1]heptachord

   HEP'TACHORD, n. [Gr. seven, and chord.] A system of seven sounds. In
   ancient poetry, verses sung or played on seven chords or different
   notes. In this sense the word was applied to the lyre, when it had but
   seven strings. One of the intervals is also called a heptachord, as
   containing the same number of degrees between the extremes.

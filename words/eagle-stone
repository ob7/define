   E'AGLE-STONE, n. Etite, a variety of argillaceous oxyd of iron,
   occurring in masses varying from the size of a walnut to that of a
   man's head. Their form is spherical, oval or nearly reniform, or
   sometimes like a parallelopiped with rounded edges and angles. They
   have a rough surface, and are essentially composed of concentric
   layers. These nodules often embrace at the center a kernel or nucleus,
   sometimes movable, and always differing from the exterior in color,
   density and fracture. To these hollow nodules the ancients gave the
   name of eagle-stones, from an opinion that the eagle transported them
   to her nest to facilitate the laying of her eggs.

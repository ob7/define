   EMERGE, v.i. emerj'. [L. emergo; e, ex, and mergo, to plunge.]

   1. To rise out of a fluid or other covering or surrounding substance;
   as, to emerge from the water or from the ocean.

   That is--emerging from the deep.

   We say, a planet emerges from the sun's light; a star emerging from
   chaos. It is opposed to immerge.

   2. To issue; to proceed from.

   3. To reappear, after being eclipsed; to leave the sphere of the
   obscuring object.

   The sun is said to emerge, when the moon ceases to obscure its light;
   the satellites of Jupiter emerge, when they appear beyond the limb of
   the planet.

   4. To rise out of a state of depression or obscurity; to rise into
   view; as, to emerge from poverty or obscurity; to emerge from the gloom
   of despondency.

   TAL'MUD, n. The body of the Hebrew laws, traditions and explanations;
   or the book that contains them. The Talmud contains the laws, and a
   compilation of expositions of duties imposed on the people, either in
   Scripture, by tradition, or by authority of their doctors, or by
   custom. It consists of two parts, the Mischna, and the Gemara; the
   former being the written law, the latter a collection of traditions and
   comments of Jewish doctors.

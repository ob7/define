   called rocks; and very small concretions are universally called gravel
   or sand, or grains of sand. Stones are of various degrees of hardness
   and weight; they are brittle and fusible, but not malleable, ductile,
   or soluble in water. Stones are of great and extensive use int he
   construction of buildings of all kinds, for walls, fences, piers,
   abutments, arches, monuments, sculpture and the like. When we speak of

   a stone, or the stones.

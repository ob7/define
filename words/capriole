   CAPRIOLE, n. In the manege, caprioles are leaps that a horse makes in
   the same place without advancing, in such a manner that when he is at
   the highth of the leap, he jerks out with his hind legs, even and near.
   It differs from the croupade in this, that, in a croupade, a horse does
   not show his shoes, and from a balotade, in which he does not jerk out.

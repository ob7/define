   PLAT'YPUS, n. A quadruped of New Holland, whose jaws are elongated into
   the shape of a duck's bill. The body is covered with thick hair and the
   feet are webbed.

   This animal has been arranged with the Mammalia, but it is now presumed
   to be oviparous; at least its breasts have not hitherto been observed.

   forth from concealment, as through a narrow avenue.

   2. To look through a crevice; to look narrowly, closely or slyly.

   A fool will peep in at the door.

   Thou are a maid and must not peep.

   3. To cry, as chickens; to utter a fine shrill sound, as through a
   crevice; usually written pip, but without reason, as it is the same
   word as is here defined, and in America is usually pronounced peep.

               PEEP, n. First appearance; as the peep of day.

   1. A sly look, or a look through a crevice.

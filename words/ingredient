[1]ingredient

   INGRE'DIENT, n. [L. ingrediens, entering into; ingredior; in and
   gradior. See Grade.]

   That which enters into a compound, or is a component part of any
   compound or mixture. It is particularly applied to the simples in
   medicinal compositions, but admits of a very general application. We
   say, an ointment or a decoction is composed of certain ingredients; and
   Addison wondered that learning was not thought a proper ingredient in
   the education of a woman of quality or fortune.

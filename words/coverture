   COVERTURE, n.

   1. Covering; shelter; defense.

   2. In law, the state of a married woman, who is considered as under
   cover, or the power of her husband, and therefore called a feme-covert,
   or femme-couvert. The coverture of a woman disables her from making
   contracts to the prejudice of herself or husband, without his allowance
   or confirmation.

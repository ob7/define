[1]negro

   NEGRO, n. [It is remarkable that our common people retain the exact
   Latin pronunciation of this word, neger.] A native or descendant of the
   black race of men in Africa. The word is never applied to the tawny or
   olive colored inhabitants of the northern coast of Africa, but to the
   more southern race of men who are quite black.

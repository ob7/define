   MISPRISION, n. misprizh'un. [supra.] Neglect; contempt.

   1. In law, any high offense under the degree of capital, but nearly
   bordering thereon. Misprision is contained in every treason and felony.
   Misprisions are divided into negative and positive; negative, which
   consist in the concealment of something which ought to be revealed; and
   positive, which consist in the commission of something which ought not
   to be done. Misprision of treason, consists in a bare knowledge and
   concealment of treason, without assenting to it.

   Maladministration in offices of high public trust, is a positive
   misprision.

   1. Mistake; oversight; contempt. [Not in use.]

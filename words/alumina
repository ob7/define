[1]alumina

   ALU'MINA, n. An earth or earthy substance, which has been considered to
   be elementary, and called pure clay; but recently, chimical experiments
   have given reason to believe it to be a metallic oxyd, to the base of
   which has been given the name aluminum. This metallic base however has
   not been obtained in such a state as to make its properties susceptible
   of examination. Alumina is destitute of taste and smell. When moistened
   with water, it forms a cohesive and ductile mass, susceptible of being
   kneaded into regular forms.

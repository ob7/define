   MATHEMAT'ICS, n. [L. mathematica, from Gr. to learn.] The science of
   quantity; the science which treats of magnitude and number, or of
   whatever can be measured or numbered. This science is divided into pure
   or speculative, which considers quantity abstractly, without relation
   to matter; and mixed, which treats of magnitude as subsisting in
   material bodies, and is consequently interwoven with physical
   considerations. It is the peculiar excellence of mathematics, that its
   principles are demonstrable. Arithmetic, geometry, algebra,
   trigonometry, and conic sections, are branches of mathematics.

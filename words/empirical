[1]empirical

   EMPIR'ICAL, a. Pertaining to experiments or experience.

   1. Versed in experiments; as an empiric alchimist.

   2. Known only by experience; derived from experiment; used and applied
   without science; as empiric skill; empiric remedies.

   I have avoided that empirical morality that cures one vice by means of
   another.

[1]tender

   TEND'ER, n. [from tend.] One that attends or takes care of; a nurse.

   1. A small vessel employed to attend a larger one for supplying her
   with provisions and other stores, or to convey intelligence and the
   like.

   2. In law, an offer, either of money to pay a debt, or of service to be
   performed, in order to save a penalty or forfeiture which would be
   incurred by non-payment or non-performance; as the tender of rent due,
   or of the amount of a note or bond with interest. To constitute a legal
   tender, such money must be offered as the law prescribes; the offer of
   bank notes is not a legal tender. So also the tender must be at the
   time and place where the rent or debt ought to be paid, and it must be
   to the full amount due.

   There is also a tender of issue in pleadings, a tender of an oath, &c.

   3. Any offer for acceptance. The gentleman made me a tender of his
   services.

   4. The thing offered. This money is not a legal tender.

   5. Regard; kind concern. [Not in use.]

                          TEND'ER, v.t. [L. tendo.]

   1. To offer in words; or to exhibit or present for acceptance.

   All conditions, all minds tender down

   Their service to lord Timon.

   2. To hold; to esteem.

   Tender yourself more dearly. [Not in use.]

   3. To offer in payment or satisfaction of a demand, for saving a
   penalty or forfeiture; as, to tender the amount of rent or debt.

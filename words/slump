   SLUMP, v.i. To fall or sink suddenly into water or mud, when walking on
   a hard surface, as on ice or frozed ground, not strong enough to bear
   the person. [This legitimate word is in common and respectable use in
   New England, and its signification is so approriate that no onther word
   wil supply its place.]

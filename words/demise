   DEMISE, n. S as z. [L. Literally, a laying down, or sending from; a
   removing.]

   1. In England, a laying down or removal, applied to the crown or royal
   authority. The demise of the crown, is a transfer of the crown, royal
   authority or kingdom to a successor. Thus when Edward fourth was driven
   from his throne for a few months by the house of Lancaster, this
   temporary transfer of his dignity was called a demise. Hence the
   natural death of a king or queen came to be denominated a demise, as by
   that event, the crown is transferred to a successor.

   2. A conveyance or transfer of an estate, by lease or will.

   Demise and redemise, a conveyance where there are mutual leases made
   from one to another of the same land, or something out of it.

                            DEMISE, v.t. S as z.

   1. To transfer or convey; to lease.

   2. To bequeath; to grant by will.

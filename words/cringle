[1]cringle

   CRINGLE, n. [See Crank and Cringe.]

   1. A withe for fastening a gate. [Local.]

   2. In marine language, a hole in the boltrope of a sail, formed by
   intertwisting the division of a rope, called a strand, alternately
   round itself, and through the strand of the colt-rope, till it becomes
   three-fold, and takes the shape of a ring. Its use is to receive the
   ends of the ropes by which the sail is drawn up to its yard, or to
   extend the leech by the bow-line-bridles.

   Iron-cringles or hanks, are open rings running on the stays, to which
   the heads of the stay sails are made fast.

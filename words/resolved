[1]resolved

   RESOLV'ED, pp.

   1. Separated into its component parts; analyzed.

   2. Determined in purpose; as, I am resolved not to keep company with
   gamesters. This phrase is properly, "I have resolved;" as we say, a
   person is deceased, or has deceased; he is retired, or has retired. In
   these phrases, the participle is rather an adjective.

   3. Determined officially or by vote.

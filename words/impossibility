   IMPOSSIBIL'ITY, n. [from impossible.]

   1. That which cannot be; the state of being not possible to exist. That
   a thing should be and not be at the same time, is an impossibility.

   2. Impracticability; the state or quality of being not feasible or
   possible to be done. That a man by his own strength should lift a ship
   of the line, is to him an impossibility, as the means are inadequate to

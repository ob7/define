[1]digress

   DIGRESS, v.i. [L., to step. See Grade.]

   1. Literally, to step or go from the way or road; hence, to depart or
   wander from the main subject, design or tenor of a discourse, argument
   or narration; used only of speaking or writing.

   In the pursuit of an argument there is hardly room to digress into a
   particular definition, as often as a man varies the signification of
   any term.

   2. To go out of the right way or common track; to deviate; in a literal
   sense. [Not now in use.]

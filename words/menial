   ME'NIAL, a.

   1. Pertaining to servants or domestic servants; low; mean.

   The women attendants perform only the most menial offices.

    [Johnson observes on this passage, that Swift seems not to have known
   the meaning of this word. But this is the only sense in which it is now
                                   used.]

   2. Belonging to the retinue or train of servants.

   Two menial dogs before their master pressed.

    [If this definition of Johnson is correct,it indicates that menial is
    from meinez, many, rather than from mesnie, family. But the sense may
                               be house-dogs.]

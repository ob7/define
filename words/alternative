   ALTERN'ATIVE, a. Offering a choice of two things.

   ALTERN'ATIVE, n. That which may be chosen or omitted; a choice of two
   things, so that if one is taken, the other must be left. Thus, when two
   things offer a choice of one only, the two things are called
   alternatives. In strictness, then, the word can not be applied to more
   than two things, and when one thing only is offered for choice, it is
   said there is no alternative.

   Between these alternatives there is no middle ground.

   FIELD, n.

   1. A piece of land inclosed for tillage or pasture; any part of a farm,
   except the garden and appurtenances of the mansion; properly land not
   covered with wood, and more strictly applicable to tillage land than to
   mowing land, which is often called meadow. But we say, the master of
   the house is in the field with his laborers, when he is at a distance
   from his house on his farm. He is in the field, plowing, sowing,
   reaping or making hay.

   2. Ground not inclosed.

   3. The ground where a battle is fought.

   We say, the field of battle; these veterans are excellent soldiers in
   the field.

   4. A battle; action in the field.

   What though the field be lost.

   5. To keep the field, is to keep the campaign open; to live in tents,
   or to be in a state of active operations. At the approach of cold
   weather, the troops, unable to keep the field, were ordered into winter
   quarters.

   6. A wide expanse.

   Ask of yonder argent fields above.

   7. Open space for action or operation; compass; extent. This subject
   opens a wide field for contemplation.

   8. A piece or tract of land.

   The field I give thee and the cave that is therein.

                                  Gen. 23.

   9. The ground or blank space on which figures are drawn; as the field
   or ground of a picture.

   10. In heraldry, the whole surface of the shield, or the continent.

   11. In scripture, field often signifies the open country, ground not
   inclosed, as it may in some countries in modern times.

   12. A field of ice, a large body of floating ice.

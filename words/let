[1]let

   LET, v.t. pret. and pp. let. Letted is obsolete. [To let out, like L.
   elocare, is to lease.]

   1. To permit; to allow; to suffer; to give leave or power by a positive
   act, or negatively, to withhold restraint; not to prevent. A leaky ship
   lets water enter into the hold. Let is followed by the infinitive
   without the sign to.

   Pharaoh said, I will let you go. Ex. 8.

   When the ship was caught and could not bear up into the wind, we let
   her drive. Acts 27.

   2. To lease; to grant possession and use for a compensation; as, to let
   to farm; to let an estate for a year; to let a room to lodgers; often
   followed by out, as, to let out a farm; but the use of out is
   unnecessary.

   3. To suffer; to permit; with the usual sign of the infinitive.

   There's a letter for you, Sir, if your name be Horatio, as I am let to
   know it is. [Not used.]

   4. In the imperative mode, let has the following uses. Followed by the
   first and third persons, it expresses desire or wish; hence it is used
   in prayer and entreaty to superiors, and to those who have us in their
   power; as, let me not wander from thy commandments. Ps. 119.

   Followed by the first person plural, let expresses exhortation or
   entreaty; as, rise, let us go.

   Followed by the third person, it implies permission or command
   addressed to an inferior. Let him go, let them remain, are commands
   addressed to the second person. Let thou, or let ye, that is, do thou
   or you permit him to go.

   Sometimes let is used to express a command or injunction to a third
   person. When the signal is given to engage, let every man do his duty.

   When applied to things not rational, it implies allowance or
   concession.

   O'er golden sands let rich Pactolus flow.

   5. To retard; to hinder; to impede; to interpose obstructions. 2Thess.
   2.

   [This sense is now obsolete, or nearly so.]

   To let alone, to leave; to suffer to remain without intermeddling; as,
   let alone this idle project; let me alone.

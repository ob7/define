[1]regrate

   REGRA'TE, v.t.

   1. To offend; to shock. [Little used.]

   2. To buy provisions and sell them again in the same market or fair; a
   practice which, by raising the price is a public offense and
   punishable. Regrating differs from engrossing and monopolizing, which
   signify the buying the whole of certain articles, or large quantities,
   and from forestalling, which signifies the purchase of provisions on
   the way, before they reach the market.

   of zink, much used in the composition of brass. This term is applied
   both to the siliceous oxyd and the native carbonate of zink. They an
   scarcely be distinguished by their external characters. They are
   generally compact, often stalactitic, and sometimes crystalized. Most
   of the calamines of England and Scotland are said to be carbonates.

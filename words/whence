[1]whence

   WHENCE, adv.

   1. From what place.

   Whence and what art thou?

   2. From what source. Whence shall we derive hope? Whence comes this
   honor?

   Whence hath this man this wisdom? Matthew 13.

   3. From which premises, principles or facts. These facts or principles
   are admitted, whence it follows, that judgment must be entered for the
   plaintiff.

   4. How; by what way or means. Mark 12.

   5. In general, from which person, cause, place, principle or
   circumstance.

   From whence may be considered as tautological, from being implied in
   whence; but the use is well authorized, and in some cases the use of it
   seems to give force or beauty to the phrase. We ascended the mountain,
   from whence we took a view of the beautiful plains below.

   Of whence is not now used.

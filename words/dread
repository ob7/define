   DREAD, n. Dred. [L., to dread; fearful; to tremble. The primary sense
   is probably to tremble, or to shrink.]

   1. Great fear, or apprehension of evil or danger. It expresses more
   than fear, and less than terror or fright. It is an uneasiness or alarm
   excited by expected pain, loss or other evil. We speak of the dread of
   evil; the dread of suffering; the dread of the divine displeasure. It
   differs from terror also in being less sudden or more continued.

   2. Awe; fear united with respect.

   3. Terror.

   Shall not his dread fall on you. Job 13.

   4. The cause of fear; the person or the thing dreaded.

   Let him be your dread. Isaiah 8.

   To peep narrowly; to inspect closely; to attempt to discover something
   with scrutinizing curiosity, whether impertinently or not; as, to pry
   into the mysteries of nature, or into the secrets of state.

   Nor need we with a prying eye survey

   The distant skies to find the milky way.

               PRY, n. Narrow inspection; impertinent peeping.

   PRY, v.t. To raise or attempt to raise with a lever. This is the common

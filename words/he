[1]he

   HE, pronoun of the third person; nom. he; poss.his; obj. him. [L. id,
   for hid; hic.]

   1. A pronoun, a substitute for the third person, masculine gender,
   representing the man or male person named before.

   Thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. Gen.3.

   Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God; him shalt thou serve. Deut.10.

   2. It often has reference to a person that is named in the subsequent
   part of the sentence. He is the man.

   3. He is often used without reference to any particular person, and may
   be referred to any person indefinitely that answers the description. It
   is then synonymous with any man.

   He that walketh with wise men, shall be wise. Prov.13.

   4. He, when a substitute for man in its general sense, expressing
   mankind, is of common gender, representing, like its antecedent, the
   whole human race.

   My Spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh.
   Gen.6.

   5. Man; a male.

   I stand to answer thee, or any he the proudest of thy sort.

   In this use of he, in the ludicrous style, the word has no variation of
      case. In the foregoing sentence, he is in the objective case, or
            position, and the word is to be considered as a noun.

   6. He is sometimes prefixed to the names of animals to designate the
   male kind, as a he-goat, a he-bear. In such cases, he is to be
   considered as an adjective, or the two words as forming a compound.

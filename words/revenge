[1]revenge

   REVENGE, v.t. revenj'. [L. vindex, vindico. See Vindicate.]

   1. To inflict pain or injury in return for an injury received.

   [Note. this word and avenge were formerly used as synonymous, and it is
   so used in the common version of the Scripture, and applied to the
   Supreme Being. "O Lord - revenge me of my persecutors." Jer. 15. In
   consequence of a distinction between avenge and revenge which modern
   usage has introduced, the application of this word to the Supreme Being
   appears extremely harsh, irreverent and offensive. Revenge is now used
   in an ill sense, for the infliction of pain maliciously or illegally;
   avenge for inflicting just punishment.]

   2. According to modern usage, to inflict pain deliberately and
   maliciously, contrary to the laws of justice and humanity, in return
   for injury, pain or evil received; to wreak vengeance spitefully on one
   who injures or offends. We say, to revenge an injury or insult, or with
   the reciprocal pronoun, to revenge ourselves on an enemy or for an
   injury, that is, to take vengeance or satisfaction.

   3. To vindicate by punishment of an enemy.

   The gods are just and will revenge our cause.

   [According to modern usage, avenge should here be substituted for
   revenge.]

                            REVENGE, n. revenj'.

   1. Return of an injury; the deliberate infliction of pain or injury or
   a person in return for an injury received from him.

   2. According to modern usage, a malicious or spiteful infliction of
   pain or injury, contrary to the laws of justice and christianity, in
   return for an injury or offense. Revenge is dictated by passion;
   vengeance by justice.

   3. The passion which is excited by an injury done or an affront given;
   the desire of inflicting pain on one who has done an injury; as, to
   glut revenge.

   Revenge, as the word is now understood, is always contrary to the
   precepts of Christ.

   The indulgence of revenge tends to make men more savage and cruel.

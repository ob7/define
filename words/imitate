[1]imitate

   IMI'TATE, v.t. [L. imitor; allied perhaps to Gr. similar, equal.]

   1. To follow in manners; to copy in form, color or quality. We imitate
   another in dress or manners; we imitate a statue, a painting, a sound,
   an action, when we make or do that which resembles it. We should seek
   the best models to imitate, and in morals and piety, it is our duty to
   imitate the example of our Savior. But as we cannot always make an
   exact similitude of the original,hence,

   2. To attempt or endeavor to copy or resemble; as, to imitate the
   colors of the rainbow, or any of the beauties of nature. Cicero appears
   to have imitated the Greek orators.

   3. To counterfeit.

   This hand appear'd a shining sword to wield,

   And that sustain'd an imitated shield.

   4. To pursue the course of a composition, so as to use like images and
   examples.

   carrying off impurities or whatever is superfluous; applied to the
   body; as,the bowels are cleansed by purgation. So also in pharmacy and

   2. In law, the act of cleansing from a crime, accusation or suspicion
   of guilt. This was canonical or vulgar. Canonical purgation, prescribed
   by the canon law, was performed before the bishop or his deputy, and by
   a jury of twelve clerks. The party accused first made oath to his own
   innocence,and then the twelve clerks or compurgators swore that they
   believed he spoke the truth; after which, other witnesses were examined
   upon oath, on behalf of the prisoner only. Vulgar purgation was
   performed by the ordeal of fire or water, or by combat. [See Ordeal.]

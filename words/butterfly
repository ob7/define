   BUT'TERFLY, n. [from the color of a yellow species.]

   Papilio, a genus of insects, of the order of lepidopters. They have
   four wings imbricated with a kind of downy scales; the tongue is
   convoluted in a spiral form; and the body is hairy. The species are
   numerous. Butter-flies proceed from the crysalids of caterpillars;
   caterpillars proceed from eggs deposited by butterflies; they then
   change into crysalids, which produce butterflies, which again deposit
   their eggs.

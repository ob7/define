[1]suspicion

   SUSPI'CION, n. [L. suspicio. See Suspect.] The act of suspecting; the
   imagination of the existence of something without proof, or upon very
   slight evidence, or upon no evidence at all. Suspicion often proceeds
   from the apprehension of evil; it is the offspring or companion of
   jealousy.

   Suspicions among thoughts, are like bats among birds; they ever fly by
   twilight.

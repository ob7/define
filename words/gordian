[1]gordian

   GORD'IAN, a. Intricate. [See the next word.]

   Gordian knot, in antiquity, a knot in the leather or harness of
   Gordius, a king of Phrygia, so very intricate, that there was no
   finding where it began or ended. An oracle declared that he who should
   untie this knot should be master of Asia. Alexander, fearing that his
   inability to untie it should prove an ill augury, cut it asunder with
   his sword. Hence, in modern language, a Gordian knot is an inextricable
   difficulty; and to cut the Gordian knot, is to remove a difficulty by
   bold or unusual measures.

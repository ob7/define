   STEEP, v.t. [probably formed on the root of dip.] To soak in a liquid;
      to macerate; to imbue; to keep any thing in a liquid till it has
    thoroughly imbibed it, or till the liquor has extracted the essential
      qualities of the substance. Thus cloth is steeped in lye or other
     liquid in bleaching or dyeing. But plants and drugs are steeped in
   water, wine and the like, for the purpose of tincturing the liquid with
                              their qualities.

     STEEP, n. A liquid for steeping grain or seeds; also, a runnet bag.

   TOAST, v.t. [L. tostus.]

   1. To dry and scorch by the heat of a fire; as, to toast bread or
   cheese. [It is chiefly limited in its application to these two
   articles.]

   2. To warm thoroughly; as, to toast the feet. [Not much used.]

   3. To name when a health is drank; to drink to the health in honor of;
   as, to toast a lady. Addison writes "to toast the health;" a form of
   expression I believe not now used.

   melted butter, or in some liquor. Dry toast is bread scorched, or it is
      scorched bread with butter spread upon it. Soft toast is made by
     immersing toasted bread in melted butter, and called dipped toast.

   The wise man's passion, and the vain man's toast.

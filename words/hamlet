[1]hamlet

   HAM'LET, n. A small village; a little cluster of houses in the country.

   This word seems originally to have signified the seat of a freeholder,
   comprehending the mansion house and adjacent buildings. It now denotes
   a small collection of houses in the country, in distinction from a
   city, a large town or township.

   The country wasted and the hamlets burned.

[1]elegancy

   EL'EGANCY, n. [L. elegantia, eligo, to choose, though irregularly
   formed.]

   In its primary sense, this word signified that which is choice or
   select, as distinguished from what is common.

   1. "The beauty of propriety, not of greatness," says Johnson.

   Applied to manners or behavior, elegance is that fine polish,
   politeness or grace, which is acquired by a genteel education, and an
   association with wellbred company.

   Applied to language, elegance respects the manner of speaking or of
   writing. Elegance of speaking is the propriety of diction and
   utterance, and the gracefulness of action or gesture; comprehending
   correct, appropriate and rich expressions, delivered in an agreeable
   manner. Elegance of composition consists in correct, appropriate and
   rich expressions, or well chosen words, arranged in a happy manner.
   Elegance implies neatness, purity, and correct, perspicuous
   arrangement, and is calculated to please a delicate taste, rather than
   to excite admiration or strong feeling. Elegance is applied also to
   form. Elegance in architecture, consists in the due symmetry and
   distribution of the parts of an edifice, or in regular proportions and
   arrangement. And in a similar sense,the word is applied to the person
   or human body. It is applied also to penmanship, denoting that form of
   letters which is most agreeable to the eye. In short, in a looser
   sense, it is applied to many works of art or nature remarkable for
   their beauty; as elegance of dress or furniture.

   2. That which pleases by its nicety, symmetry, purity or beauty. In
   this sense it has a plural; as the nicer elegancies of art.

[1]x

   X, the twenty fourth letter of the English Alphabet, is borrowed from
   the Greek. In the middle and at the end of words, it has the sound of
   ks, as in wax, lax, luxury. At the beginning of a word, it has
   precisely the sound of z. It is used as an initial, in a few words
   borrowed from the Greek.

   As a numeral, X stands for ten. It represents one V, which stands for
   five, placed on the top of another. When laid horizontally it stands
   for a thousand, and with a dash over it, it stands for ten thousand. As
   an abbreviation, X. Stands for Christ, and in Xn. Christian; Xm.
   Christmas.

[1]village

   VIL'LAGE, n. A small assemblage of houses, less than a town or city,
   and inhabited chiefly by farmers and other laboring people. In England,
   it is said that a village is distinguished from a town by the want of a
   market.

   In the United States, no such distinction exists, and any small
   assemblage of houses in the country is called a village.

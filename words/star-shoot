[1]star-shoot

   STAR-SHOOT, n. [star and shoot.] That which is emitted from a star.

   I have seen a good quantity of that jelly, by the vulgar called a
   star-shoot, as if it remained upon the extinction of a falling star.

   [The writer once saw the same kind of substance from a brilliant
   meteor, at Amherst in Massachusetts. See Journ. Of Science for a
   description of it by Rufus Graves, Esq.]

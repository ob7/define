   MOON, n.

   1. The heavenly orb which revolves round the earth; a secondary planet

   earth and serves to dispel the darkness of night. Its mean distance
   from the earth is 60 1/2 semidiameters of the earth, or 240,000 miles.
   Its revolution round the earth in 27 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes,
   constitutes the lunar month.

   2. A month. This is the sense in which rude nations use the name of the
   moon; as seven moons.

[1]shire

   SHIRE, n. In England, a division of territory, otherwise called a
   county. The shire was originally a division of the kingdom under the
   jurisdiction of an earl or count, whose authority was entrusted to the
   sherif. [shire-reeve.] On this officer the goverment ultimately
   devolved. In the United States, the corresponding division of a state
   is called a county, but we retain shire in the in the compound
   half-shire; as when the county court is held in two towns in the same
   county alternately, we call one of the divisions a half-shire.

   In some states, shire as the constituent part of the name of a county,
   as Berkshire, Hampshire, in Massachusetts. These being the names
   established by law, we cannot say, the county of Berkshire, and we
   cannot with propriety say, the caounty of Berks, for there is no county
   in Massa chusetts thus named.

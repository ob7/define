   The beating of flax and hemp is an operation which renders them more
   soft and pliable. For this purpose, they are made into rolls and laid
   in a trough, where they are beat, till no roughness or hardness can be
   felt.

   In book binding, beating is performed by laying the book in quires or
   sheets folded, on a block, and beating it with a heavy broad-faced
   hammer. On this operation the elegance of the binding and the easy
   opening of the book chiefly depend.

   Beating the wind, was a practice in the ancient trial by combat. If one
   of the combatants did not appear on the field, the other was to beat
   the wind, by making flourishes with his weapons; by which he was
   entitled to the advantages of a conqueror.

   Beatings, in music, the regular pulsative swellings of sound, produced
   in an organ by pipes of the same key, when not in unison, and their
   vibrations not simultaneous or coincident.

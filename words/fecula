[1]fecula

   FEC'ULA, n.

   1. The green matter of plants; chlorophyll.

   2. Starch or farina; called also amylaceous fecula.

   This term is applied to any pulverulent matter obtained from plants by
   simply breaking down the texture, washing with water, and subsidence.
   Hence its application to starch and the green fecula, though entirely
   different in chimical properties.

   FASTIG'IATED, a. [L. fastigiatus, pointed, from fastigio, to point,
   fastigium, a top or peak.]

   height. Peduncles are fastigiate, when they elevate the fructifications
   in a bunch, so as to be equally high, or when they form an even surface
   at the top.

   2. Roofed; narrowed to the top.

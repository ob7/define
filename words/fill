   FILL, v.t. [Gr. allied perhaps to fold and felt; to stuff; L. pilus,

   thrust or drive, L. pello, and contracted, it is rendered to fill, and
   is full.]

   1. Properly, to press; to crowd; to stuff. Hence, to put or pour in,
   till the thing will hold no more; as, to fill a basket, a bottle, a

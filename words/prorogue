[1]prorogue

   PROROGUE, v.t. prorog. [L. prorogo; pro and rogo. The latter word
   signifies to ask, or to propose; but the primary sense is to reach, to
   stretch forward; and this is its import in the derivative prorogo.]

   1. To protract; to prolong.

   He prorogued his government.

   2. To defer; to delay; as, to prorogue death.

   [In the foregoing senses, the word is now rarely used.]

   3. To continue the parliament from one session to another. Parliament
   is prorogued by the king's authority, either by the lord chancellor in
   his majesty's presence, or by commission, or by proclamation.

[1]bucanier

   BUCANIE'R, n. Primarily, a buccaneer is said to one who dries and
   smokes flesh or fish after the manner of the Indians. The name was
   first given to the French settlers in Haiti or Hispaniola, whose
   business was to hunt wild cattle and swine. It was afterwards applied
   to the piratical adventurers, English and French, who combined to make
   depredations on the Spaniards in America.

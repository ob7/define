[1]ode

   ODE, n. [L. ode; Gr.] A short poem or song; a poetical composition
   proper to be set to music or sung; a lyric poem. The ode is of the
   greater or less kind; the less is characterized by sweetness and ease;
   the greater by sublimity, rapture and quickness of transition.

   Pindar has left Olympic odes, Pythian odes, Nemean odes, and Isthmian
   odes.

   The ode consists of unequal verses in stanzas or strophes.

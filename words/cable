[1]cable

   CABLE, n. cabl. A large strong rope or chain, used to retain a vessel
   at anchor. It is made usually of hemp or iron, but may be made of other
   materials. Cables are of different sizes, according to the bulk of the
   vessel for which they are intended, from three to twenty inches in
   circumference. A cable is composed of three strands; each strand of
   three ropes; and each rope of three twists. A ships cable is usually
   120 fathom, or 720 feet, in length. Hence the expression, a cables
   length.

   Stream cable is a hawser or rope, smaller than the bower cables, to
   moor a ship in a place sheltered from wind and heavy seas.

   To pay out, or to veer out the cable, is to slacken it that it may run
   out of the ship.

   To serve the cable, is to bind it round with ropes, canvas, &c., to
   prevent its being worn or galled in the hawse.

   To slip the cable, is to let it run out end for end.

   SINCE,prep or adv.

   1. After; from the time that. The proper signification of since is
   after, and its appropriate sense includes the whole period between an
   event and the present time. I have not seen my brother since January.
   The Lord hath blessed thee, since my coming. Gen. 30. Holy prophets,
   who have been since the world began. Luke l. John 9. Since then
   denotes, during the whole time after an event; or at any particular
   time during that period.

   2. Ago; past; before this. "About two years since, an event happened,"
   that is, two years having passed.

   3. Because that; this being the fact that. Since truth and constancy
   are vain, since neither love nor sese of pain nor force of reason can
   persuade, then let example be obey'd. Since, when it precedes a noun,
   is called a preposition, but when it precedes sentence it is called an
   adverb. The truth is, the character of the word is the same in both
   cases. It is probably an obsolete participle, and according to the
   usual classification of words, may be properly ranked with the
   prepositions. In strictness, the last clause of the passage above cited
   is the case absolute. "The Lord hath blessed the, since my coming,"
   that is, my arrival being past. So, since the world began, is strictly
   past the world began, the beginning of the world being past. In the
   first case, since considered as a preposition, has coming, a noun, for
   its object, and in the latter case, the clause of a sentence. So we
   say, against your arrival, or against you come.

   MUSK, n. [L. muscus; Gr.musk, and moss.] A strong scented substance
   obtained from a cyst or bag near the navel of the Thibet musk [Moschus
   moschiferus,] an animal that inhabits the Asiatic Alps, especially the
   Altaic chain. This animal is a little more than three feet in length;
   the head resembles that of the roe,the fur is coarse, like that of the
   cervine race, but thick, erect, smooth and soft. It has no horns, but
   the male has two long tusks, one on each side, projecting from the
   mouth. The female is smaller than the male and has neither tusks nor
   follicle. The cyst of the male is about the size of a hen's egg, oval,
   flat on one side and rounded on the other, having a small orifice. This
   contains a clotted, oily, friable matter of a dark brown color, which
   is the true musk, one of the strongest odors or perfumes in nature. We
   give the name to the substance and to the animal.

   MUSK, n. Grape-hyacinth or grape-flower.

   MUSK, v.t. To perfume with musk.

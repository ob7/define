   SIB'YL, n. [from the L.] In pagan antiquity, the Sibyls were certain
   said to be endowed with a prophetic spirit. Their number is variously
   stated; but the opinion of Varro, who states them to have been ten, is
   generally adopted. They resided in various parts of Persia, Greece and
   Italy. It is pretended that they wrote certain prophecies on leaves in
   verse, which are called Sibylline verses, or Sibylline oracles.

   PROPRI'ETY, n. [L. proprietas, from proprius.]

   1. Property; peculiar or exclusive right of possession; ownership.
   [This primary sense of the word, as used by Locke, Milton, Dryden, &c.
   seems not to be nearly or wholly obsolete. See Property.]

   2. Fitness; suitableness; appropriateness; consonance with established
   principles, rules or customs; justness; accuracy. Propriety of conduct,
   in a moral sense, consists in its conformity to the moral law;
   propriety of behavior, consists in conformity to the established rules
   of decorum; propriety in language, is correctness in the use of words
   and phrases, according to established usage, which constitutes the rule
   of speaking and writing.

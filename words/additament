   ADDIT'AMENT, n. [L. additamentum, from additus and ment. See Add.]

   An addition, or rather the thing added, as furniture in a house; any
   material mixed with the principal ingredient in a compound. Ancient
   anatomists gave the name to an epiphysis, or junction of bones without
   articulation. [Little used in either sense.]

[1]ambition

   AMBI'TION, n. [L. ambitio, from ambio, to go about, or to seek by
   making interest, of amb, about, and eo, to go. See Ambages. This word
   had its origin in the practice of Roman candidates for office, who went
   about the city to solicit votes.]

   A desire of preferment, or of honor; a desire of excellence or
   superiority. It is used in a good sense; as, emulation may spring from
   a laudable ambition. It denotes also an inordinate desire of power, or
   eminence, often accompanied with illegal means to obtain the object. It
   is sometimes followed by of; as, a man has an ambition of wit. Milton
   has used the word in the Latin sense of going about, or attempting; but
   this sense is hardly legitimate.

          AMBI'TION, v.t. Ambitiously to seek after. [Little used.]

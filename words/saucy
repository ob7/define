[1]saucy

   SAU'CY, a. [from sauce; L. salsus, salt or salted. The use of this word
   leads to the primary sense of salt, which must be shooting forward,
   penetrating, pungent, for boldness is a shooting forward.]

   1. Impudent; bold to excess; rude; transgressing the rules of decorum;
   treating superiors with contempt. It expresses more than pert; as a
   saucy boy; a saucy fellow.

   2. Expressive of impudence; as a saucy eye; saucy looks.

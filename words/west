   WEST, n. [L., a decline or fall, departure. In elements, it coincides
   with waste.]

   1. In strictness, that point of the horizon where the sun sets at the
   equinox, or any point in a direct line between the spectator or other
   object, and that point of the horizon; or west is the intersection of
   the prime vertical with the horizon, on that side where the sun sets.
   West is directly opposite to east, and one of the cardinal points. In a
   less strict sense, west is the region of the hemisphere near the point
   where the sun sets when in the equator. Thus we say, a star sets in the
   west, a meteor appears in the west, a cloud rises in the west.

   2. A country situated in the region towards the sun-setting, with
   respect to another. Thus in the United States, the inhabitants of the
   Atlantic states speak of the inhabitants of Ohio, Kentucky or Missouri,
   and call them people of the west; and formerly, the empire of Rome was
   called the empire of the West, in opposition to the empire of the East,
   the seat of which was Constantinople.

                                  WEST, a.

   1. Being in a line towards the point where the sun sets when in the
   equator; or in a looser sense, being in the region near the line of
   direction towards that point, either on the earth or in the heavens.

   This shall be your west border. Numbers 34.

   2. Coming or moving from the west or western region; as a west wind.

    WEST, adv. To the western region; at the westward; more westward; as,
                        Ireland lies west of England.

      WEST, v.i. To pass to the west; to set, as the sun. [Not in use.]

   EDUCA'TION, n. [L. educatio.] The bringing up, as of a child,
   instruction; formation of manners. Education comprehends all that
   series of instruction and discipline which is intended to enlighten the
   understanding, correct the temper, and form the manners and habits of
   youth, and fit them for usefulness in their future stations. To give
   children a good education in manners, arts and science, is important;
   to give them a religious education is indispensable; and an immense
   responsibility rests on parents and guardians who neglect these duties.

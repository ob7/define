[1]allodium

   ALLO'DIUM, n.

   Freehold estate; land which is the absolute property of the owner; real
   estate held in absolute independence, without being subject to any
   rent, service, or acknowledgment to a superior. It is thus opposed to
   feud. In England, there is no allodial land, all land being held of the
   king; but in the United States, most lands are allodial.

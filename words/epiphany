   EPIPH'ANY, n. [Gr. appearance; to appear.] A christian festival
   celebrated on the sixth day of January, the twelfth day after
   Christmas, in commemoration of the appearance of our Savior to the
   magians or philosophers of the East, who came to adore him with
   presents; or as others maintain, to commemorate the appearance of the
   star to the magians, or the manifestation of Christ to the Gentiles.
   Jerome and Chrysostom take the epiphany to be the day of our Savior's
   baptism, when a voice from heaven declared, "This is my beloved son, in
   whom I am well pleased." The Greek fathers use the word for the
   appearance of christ in the world, the sense in which Paul used the
   word. 2 Tim. 1.10.

[1]neglect

   NEGLECT, v.t. [G. To let, to leave, to suffer to pass. The sense of the
   latter words then is to leave behind, or permit to remain; I suspect
   the L. To be composed of the same prefix, as n is not radical in the
   latter. But of this I am not confident.]

   1. To omit by carelessness or design; to forbear to do, use, employ,
   promote or attend to; as, to neglect duty or business; to neglect to
   pay honest debts; to neglect our interest or policy; to neglect the
   means in our power.

   2. To omit to receive or embrace; to slight.

   How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation? Hebrews 2.

   3. To slight; not to notice; to forbear to treat with attention or
   respect. Among people of good breeding, strangers seldom complain of
   being neglected.

   4. To postpone. [Not in use.]

                                 NEGLECT, n.

   1. Omission; forbearance to do any thing that can be done or that
   requires to be done. Neglect may be from carelessness or intention. The
   neglect of business is the cause of many failures, but neglect of
   economy is more frequent and more injurious.

   2. Slight; omission of attention or civilities. Neglect of due notice
   and attention to strangers is characteristic of ill breeding.

   3. Negligence; habitual want of regard.

   Age breeds neglect in all.

   4. State of being disregarded.

   Rescue my poor remains from vile neglect.

   PHLOGIS'TON, n. [Gr. to burn or inflame.]

   The principle of inflammability; the matter of fire in composition with
   other bodies. Stahl gave this name to an element which he supposed to
   be pure fire fixed in combustible bodies, in order to distinguish it
   from fire in action or in a state of liberty. But the theory has been
   proved to be false and is generally abandoned.

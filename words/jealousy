   JEALOUSY, n. jel'usy.

   1. That passion of peculiar uneasiness which arises from the fear that
   a rival may rob us of the affection of one whom we love, or the
   suspicion that he has already done it; or it is the uneasiness which
   arises from the fear that another does or will enjoy some advantage
   which we desire for ourselves. A man's jealousy is excited by the
   attentions of a rival to his favorite lady. A woman's jealousy is
   roused by her husband's attentions to another woman. The candidate for
   office manifests a jealousy of others who seek the same office. The
   jealousy of a student is awakened by the apprehension that his fellow
   will bear away the palm of praise. In short,jealousy is awakened by
   whatever may exalt others, or give them pleasures and advantages which
   we desire for ourselves. Jealousy is nearly allied to envy, for
   jealousy, before a good is lost by ourselves, is converted into envy,
   after it is obtained by others.

   Jealousy is the apprehension of superiority.

   Whoever had qualities to alarm our jealousy, had excellence to deserve
   our fondness.

   2. Suspicious fear or apprehension.

   3. Suspicious caution or vigilance, an earnest concern or solicitude
   for the welfare or honor of others. Such was Paul's godly jealousy for
   the Corinthians.

   character and government, with a holy indignation against those who
   violate his laws, and offend against his majesty. Ps.79.

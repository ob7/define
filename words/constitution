[1]constitution

   CONSTITUTION, n.

   1. The act of constituting, enacting, establishing, or appointing.

   2. The state of being; that form of being or peculiar structure and
   connection of parts which makes or characterizes a system or body.
   Hence the particular frame or temperament of the human body is called
   its constitution. We speak of a robust or feeble constitution; a cold,
   phlegmatic, sanguine or irritable constitution. We speak of the
   constitution of the air, or other substance; the constitution of the
   solar system; the constitution of things.

   3. The frame or temper of mind, affections or passions.

   4. The established form of government in a state, kingdom or country; a
   system of fundamental rules, principles and ordinances for the
   government of a state or nation. In free states, the constitution is
   paramount to the statutes or laws enacted by the legislature, limiting
   and controlling its power; and in the United States, the legislature is
   created, and its powers designated, by the constitution.

   5. A particular law, ordinance, or regulation, made by the authority of
   any superior, civil or ecclesiastical; as the constitutions of
   Justinian and his successors.

   6. A system of fundamental principles for the government of rational
   and social beings.

   The New Testament is the moral constitution of modern society.

[1]soon

   SOON, adv.

   1. In a short time; shortly after any time specified or supposed; as
   soon after sunrise; soon after dinner; I shall soon return; we shall
   soon have clear weather.

   2. Early; without the usual delay; before any time supposed. How is it
   that ye have come so soon to-day? Ex. 2.

   3. Readily; willingly. But in this sense it accompanies would, or some
   other word expressing will. I would as soon see a river winding among
   woods or in meadows, as when it is tossed up in so many whimsical
   figures at Versailles.

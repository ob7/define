   PLANT, n. [L. planta; splendeo, splendor.]

   1. A vegetable; an organic body, destitute of sense and spontaneous
   motion, adhering to another body in such a manner as to draw from it
   its nourishment, and having the power of propagating itself by seeds;
   "whose seed is in itself." Gen.1. This definition may not be perfectly
   correct, as it respects all plants, for some marine plants grow without
   being attached to any fixed body.

   The woody or dicotyledonous plants consist of three parts; the bark or
   exterior coat, which covers the wood; the wood which is hard and
   constitutes the principal part; and the pith or center of the stem. In
   monocotyledonous plants, the ligneous or fibrous parts, and the pithy
   or parenchymatous, are equally distributed through the whole internal
   substance; and in the lower plants, funguses, sea weed, &c. the
   substance is altogether parenchymatous. By means of proper vessels, the
   nourishing juices are distributed to every part of the plant. In its
   most general sense, plant comprehends all vegetables, trees, shrubs,
   herbs, grasses, &c. In popular language,the word is generally applied
   to the smaller species of vegetables.

   2. A sapling.

   3. In Scripture, a child; a descendant; the inhabitant of a country.
   Ps.144. Jer.48.

   4. The sole of the foot. [Little used.]

   PLANT, v.t. To put in the ground and cover, as seed for growth; as, to

[1]storm

   STORM, n. [G., to disturb. L. The primary sense of storm is a rushing,
   raging or violent agitation.[

   1. A violent wind; a tempest. Thus a storm of wind, is correct
   language, as the proper sense of the word is rushing, violence. It has
   primarily no reference to a fall of rain or snow. But as a violent wind
   is often attended with rain or snow, the word storm has come to be
   used, most improperly, for a fall of rain or snow without wind.

   O beat those storms, and roll the seas in vain.

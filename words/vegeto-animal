   VEG'ETO-ANIMAL, a. Vegeto-animal matter, is a term formerly applied to
   vegetable gluten, which is found in the seeds of certain plants, in a
   state of union with farina or starch. It is remarkably elastic, and
   when dry, semi-transparent. By distillation it affords, like animal
   substances, alkaline water, concrete volatile alkali, and an
   empyreumatic oil.

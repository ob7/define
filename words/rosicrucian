   dissolvent of gold, according to these fanatics, and cross, the emblem
   of light.]

   The Rosicrucians were a sect or cabal of hermetical philosophers, or
   rather fanatics, who sprung up in Germany in the fourteenth century,
   and made great pretensions to science; and among other things,
   pretended to be masters of the secret of the philosopher's stone.

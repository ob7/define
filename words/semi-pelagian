   SEMI-PELA'GIAN, n.In ecclesiastical history, the Semi-pelagians are
   persons who retain some tincture of the doctrines of pelagius. See
   Pelegianism. They hold that God has not by predestination dispensed his
   grace to one more than another; that Christ died to all men; that the
   grace purchased by Christ and necessary to salvation, is offered to all
   men; that man, before he receives grace, is capable of faith and holy
   desires; and that man being born free, is capable of accepting grace,
   or of resisting its influences.

   SEMI-PELA'GIAN, a. Pertaining to the Semi-pelagians, or other tenets.

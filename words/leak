   LEAK, n. [Gr. a fissure or crevice, L. lacero and loquor, and perhaps
   Eng. clack. It seems that licerish is from the root of leak, and
   signifies properly watery.]

   1. A crack, crevice, fissure or hole in a vessel, that admits water, or
   permits a fluid to escape.

   2. The oozing or passing of water or other fluid or liquor through a
   crack, fissure or aperture in a vessel, either into it, as into a ship,
   or out of it, as out of a cask.

   To spring a leak, is to open or crack so as to let in water; to being
   to let in water.

                        LEAK, a. Leaky. [Not in use.]

      LEAK, v.i. To let water or other liquor into or out of a vessel,
   through a hole or crevice in the vessel. A ship leaks, when she admits
   water through her seams or an aperture in her bottom or sides, into the
   hull. A pail or a cask leaks, when it admits liquor to pass out through
                             a hole or crevice.

   To lead out, to find vent; to escape privately from confinement or
   secrecy; as a fact or report.

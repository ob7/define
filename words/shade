[1]shade

   SHADE, n. [L. scutum, a shield.]

   1. Literally, the interception, cutting of or interruption of the rays
   of light; hence, the obscurity which is caused by such interception.
   Shad differs from shadow, as it implies no particular form or definite
   limit. whereas a shadow represents in form the object which intercepts
   the light. Hence when we say, let us resort to the shade of a tree, we
   have no reference to its form; but when we speak of measuring a pyramid
   or other object by its shadow, we have reference to its extent.

   2. Darkness; obscurity; as the shades of night.

   3. An obscure place, properly in a grove or close wood, which precludes
   the sun's rays; an hence, a secluded retreat.

   Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there

   Weep our sad bosoms empty. Shak.

   4. A screen; something that intercepts light or heat.

   5. Protection; shelter. [See Shadow.]

   6. In painting, the dark part of the picture.

   7. Degree or gradation of light.

   White, red, yellow, blue, with their several degrees, or shades and
   mixtures, as green, come only in by the eyes. Locke.

   8. A shadow. [See Shadow.]

   Envy will merit, as its shade, pursue. Pope. [This is allowable in
   poetry.]

   9. The soul, after its separation from the body; so called because the
   ancients supposed it to be perceptible to the sight, not to the touch;
   a spirit; aghost; as the shades of departed heroes.

   Swift as thought, the flitting shade- Dryden.

   SHADE, v.t.

   1. To shelter or screen from light by intercepting its rays; and when
   applied to the rays of the sun, it segnifies to shelter from light and
   heat; as, a large tree shades the plants under its branches; shaded
   vegetables rarely come to perfection.

                        I went to the sylvan scenes,

            And shade our altars with their leafy greens. Dryden.

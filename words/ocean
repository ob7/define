[1]ocean

   OCEAN, n. o'shun. [L. oceanus; Gr.; Heb. to encompass, whence a circle.
   This is probably an error. The word seems to have for its origin
   greatness or extent.]

   1. The vast body of water which covers more than three fifths of the
   surface of the globe, called also the sea, or great sea. It is
   customary to speak of the ocean as if divided into three parts, the
   Atlantic ocean, the Pacific ocean, and the Indian ocean; but the ocean
   is one mass or body, partially separated by the continents of Europe,
   Asia and Africa on one side, and by America on the other.

   2. An immense expanse; as the boundless ocean of eternity; oceans of
   duration and space.

     OCEAN, a. o'shun. Pertaining to the main or great sea; as the ocean
                             wave; ocean stream.

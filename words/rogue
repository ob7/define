   ROGUE, n. rog. [Gr., Eng. rogue, by transposition of letters. The word
   arga, in the laws of the Longobards, denotes a cuckold.]

   1. In law, a vagrant; a sturdy beggar; a vagabond. Persons of this
   character were, by the ancient laws of England, to be punished by
   whipping and having the ear bored with a hot iron.

   2. A knave; a dishonest person; applied now, I believe, exclusively to
   males. This word comprehends thieves and robbers, but is generally
   applied to such as cheat and defraud in mutual dealings, or to
   counterfeiters.

   The rogue and fool by fits is fair and wise.

   3. A name of slight tenderness and endearment.

   Alas, poor rogue, I think indeed she loves.

   4. A wag.

                              ROGUE, v.i. rog.

   1. To wander; to play the vagabond. [Little used.]

   2. To play knavish tricks. [Little used.]

[1]city

   CITY, n.

   1. In a general sense, a large town; a large number of houses and
   inhabitants, established in one place.

   2. In a more appropriate sense, a corporate town; a town or collective
   body of inhabitants, incorporated and governed by particular officers,
   as a mayor and aldermen. This is the sense of the word in the United
   States. In Great Britain, a city is said to be a town corporate that
   has a bishop and a cathedral church; but this is not always the fact.

   3. The collective body of citizens, or the inhabitants of a city; as
   when we say, the city voted to establish a market, and the city
   repealed the vote.

      CITY, a. Pertaining to a city; as city wives; a city feast; city
                                  manners.

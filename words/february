[1]february

   FEB'RUARY, n. [L. Februarius. The Latin word is said to be named from
   februo, to purify by sacrifice, and thus to signify the month of
   purification, as the people were, in this month, purified by sacrifices
   and oblations. The word februo is said to be a Sabine word, connected
   with ferveo, ferbeo, to boil, as boiling was used in purifications.

   This practice bears a resemblance to that of making atonement among the
   Jews; but the connection between ferveo and February is doubtful.

   The name of the second month in the year, introduced into the Roman
   calendar by Numa. In common years, this month contains 28 days; in the
   bissextile or leap year, 29 days.

     Shakespeare applied the word to an oath. "An oath of mickle might."
     This application is obsolete. We now use strength or force; as the
                  strength or force of an oath or covenant.

     With might and main, with the utmost strength or bodily exertion; a
   tautological phrase, as both words are from the same root, and mean the
                                 same thing.

   RIC'OCHET, n. In gunnery, the firing of guns, mortars or howitzers with
   small charges, and elevated a few degrees, so as to carry the balls or
   shells just over the parapet, and cause them to roll along the opposite
   rampart. This is called ricochet-firing, and the batteries are called
   ricochet-batteries.

[1]alter

   AL'TER, v.t. [L. alter, another. See Alien.]

   1. To make some change in; to make different in some particular; to
   vary in some degree, without an entire change.

   My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that has gone out of
   my lips. Ps. 89.

   2. To change entirely or materially; as, to alter an opinion. In
   general, to alter is to change partially; to change is more generally
   to substitute one thing for another, or to make a material difference
   in a thing.

    AL'TER, v.i. To become, in some respects, different; to vary; as, the
                        weather alters almost daily.

   The law which altereth not. Dan 4.

   GEN'DER, n. [L. genus, from geno, gigno; Gr.to beget, or to be born;
   Eng. kind. Gr. a woman, a wife; Sans. gena, a wife, and genaga, a
   father. We have begin from the same root. See Begin and Can.]

   1. Properly, kind; sort.

   2. A sex, male or female. Hence,

   3. In grammar, a difference in words to express distinction of sex;
   usually a difference of termination in nouns, adjectives and
   participles, to express the distinction of male and female. But
   although this was the original design of different terminations, yet in
   the progress of language, other words having no relation to one sex or
   the other, came to have genders assigned them by custom. Words
   expressing males are said to be of the masculine gender; those
   expressing females, of the feminine gender; and in some languages,
   words expressing things having no sex, are of the neuter or neither
   gender.

        GEN'DER, v.t. To beget; but engender is more generally used.

               GEN'DER, v.i. To copulate; to breed. Levit. 19.

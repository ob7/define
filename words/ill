   Ill bears the sex the youthful lovers' fate,

   ILL, prefixed to participles of the present tense, and denoting evil or
    wrong, may be considered as a noun governed by the participle, or as
       making a part of a compound word; as an ill meaning man, an ill
   designing man, an ill boding hour; that is, a man meaning ill, an hour
       boding ill. It is more consonant, however, to the genius of our
   language, to treat these and similar words as compounds. In some cases,
   as before the participles of intransitive verbs, ill must be considered
     as a part of the compound, as in ill-looking. When used before the
   perfect participle, ill is to be considered as an adverb, or modifying
      word, or to be treated as a part of the compound; as in ill-bred,
   ill-governed, ill-fated, ill-favored, ill-formed, ill-minded. In these
   and all similar connections, it might be well to unite the two words in
        a compound by a hyphen. As ill may be prefixed to almost any
    participle, it is needless to attempt to collect a list of such words
                               for insertion.

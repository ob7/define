   INTEG'RITY, n. [L. integritas, from integer.]

   1. Wholeness; entireness; unbroken state. The constitution of the
   U.States guaranties to each state the integrity of its territories. The
   contracting parties guarantied the integrity of the empire.

   2. The entire, unimpaired state of any thing, particularly of the mind;
   moral soundness or purity; incorruptness; uprightness; honesty.
   Integrity comprehends the whole moral character, but has a special
   reference to uprightness in mutual dealings, transfers of property,and
   agencies for others.

   The moral grandeur of independent integrity is the sublimest thing in
   nature, before which the pomp of eastern magnificence and the splendor
   of conquest are odious as well as perishable.

   3. Purity; genuine, unadulterated, unimpaired state; as the integrity
   of language.

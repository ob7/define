[1]substraction

   SUBSTRAC'TION, n. In law, the withdrawing or withholding of some right.
   Thus the substraction of conjugal rights, is when either the husband or
   wife withdraws from the other and lives separate. The substraction of a
   legacy, is the withholding or detaining of it from the legatee by the
   executor. In like manner, the withholding of any service, rent, duty or
   custom, is a substraction, for which the law gives a remedy.

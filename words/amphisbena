   AMPHISBE'NA, n. [Gr. to go; indicating that the animal moves with
   either end foremost.]

   A genus of serpents, with the head small, smooth and blunt; the
   nostrils small, the eyes minute and blackish, and the mouth furnished
   with small teeth. The body is cylindrical, destitute of scales, and
   divided into numerous annular segments; the tail obtuse, and scarcely
   to be distinguished from the head, whence the belief that it moved
   equally well with either end foremost. There are two species; the
   fuliginosa, black with white spots, found in Africa and America; and
   the alba, or white species, found in both the Indies and generally in
   ant-hillocks. They feed on ants and earth-worms, and were formerly
   deemed poisonous; but this opinion is exploded.

   The aquatic amphisben, Gordius aquaticus, Linne, is an animal
   resembling a horse hair, found in water, and moving with either end
   foremost. The vulgar opinion that this is an animated horse-hair is
   found to be an error. This hair worm is generated in the common black
   beetle, in which the parent worm lays its eggs; and is sometimes found
   in the earth and on the leaves of trees.

   CRUSTALOGY, n. [L., a shell, Gr., discourse.] That part of zoology
   which treats of crustaceous animals, arranging them in orders, tribes
   and families, and describing their forms and habits.

   [Crustaceology, the word sometimes used, is ill-formed, and its
   derivatives inconveniently long. Who can endure such words as
   crustaceological?]
